<h1>Testing the pumilio-bushfm-test-dev-prod build process, in an Open Notebook</h1>

<h4>Aims:</h4>

<p>It was suggested I could document the pumilio test build as an OpenNotebook.
I imagined that I could link this blog to github repo and doco hosted on gh-pages.</p>

<h4>Methods:</h4>

<ul>
<li>For ie the emacs html output now goes to <a href="http://ivanhanigan.github.io/pumilio-bushfm/">http://ivanhanigan.github.io/pumilio-bushfm/</a></li>
<li>then collaborators can clone/fork <a href="https://github.com/ivanhanigan/pumilio-bushfm">https://github.com/ivanhanigan/pumilio-bushfm</a></li>
<li>and comment/complain at <a href="https://github.com/ivanhanigan/pumilio-bushfm/wiki">https://github.com/ivanhanigan/pumilio-bushfm/wiki</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Results:</h4>

<ul>
<li>I did a test build a month ago on an old laptop sitting around, then rebuilt on the Nectar cloud</li>
<li>Unfortunately I didn't realise that the Nectar VM had mounted /var on to the smaller root partition (the 40GB 2nd disk is on /mnt).</li>
<li>then when I tried to upload a big sound file it broke :-(</li>
<li>I did a bit of reading and whilst I began thinking I'd just need to move the mysql datadir via</li>
</ul>


<h4>Code:</h4>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<h4>BUT</h4>

<ul>
<li>it actually looks like there is a WAV and MP3 file under /var/www/pumilio-2...</li>
<li>so I think I can <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/39536/how-can-i-store-var-on-a-separate-partition">just remount /var</a> onto the larger /mnt secondary disk.</li>
</ul>
