<li>I value precise language very highly
</li>
<li>this is because in multi-disciplinary teams it is easy to talk using the same words and mean different things
</li>
<li>in recent discussion about <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dlnm/index.html">Distributed Lag Non-linear Models</a> I started to reflect on something that has bothered me for a While
</li>
<li>back in 2005 my old mate Prof Keith Dear picked me up on using the term "non-linear model" incorrectly and explained the maths&hellip;
</li>
<li>I kind of understood but promptly forgot and found a lot of people use the term non-linear model a bit carelessly
</li>
<li>Yesterday I was in a discussion about comparing non-linear relationships between different studies in a meta-analysis
</li>
<li>I immediatly felt uncomfortable when we started to discuss these as "non-linear models"
</li>
<li>so here is a quick bit of google fu (with a session at the coffee shop with Steve and Mishka) to remind me about the difference between

A regression model is called nonlinear, if the derivatives
of the model with respect to the model parameters depends on one or
more parameters. This definition is essential to distinguish nonlinear
from curvilinear regression. A regression model is not necessarily
nonlinear if the graphed regression trend is curved. A polynomial
model such as this:
