Jonathan Schooler wrote <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110223/full/470437a.html">a recent commentary in Nature magazine</a>, and a&nbsp;story in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer?currentPage=all">The New Yorker</a> by the awesome Jonah Lehrer also discussed the decline effect. The decline effect was also discussed at the&nbsp;EEB&amp;Flow blog&nbsp;<a href="http://evol-eco.blogspot.com/2011/02/further-studies-of-decline-effect-find.html">here</a>, in response to Jonathan's article in Nature.<br /><br />I thought it was appropriate to examine the possible decline effect in ecological meta-analyses.
