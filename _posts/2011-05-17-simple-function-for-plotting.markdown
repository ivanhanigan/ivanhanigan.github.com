UPDATE: Greg jordan has a much more elegant way of plotting trees with ggplot2. See his links in the comments below.<br /><br /><br />I wrote a simple function for plotting a phylogeny in ggplot2. However, it only handles a 3 species tree right now, as I haven't figured out how to generalize the approach to N species.<br /><br />Any ideas on how to improve this?<br /><br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/977207.js?file=ggtree_v1.R"></script>
