The Public Libraries of Science (PLOS) has an API so&nbsp;that developers can create cool tools to access their data (including full text papers!!).<br /><br />Carl Boettiger at UC Davis and I are working on R functions that use the PLoS API. See our code on Github <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rplos"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;">here</span></a>. See the wiki at the Github page for examples of use. We hope to deploy rplos as a package someday soon. Please feel free to suggest changes/additions rplos in the comments below or on the Github/rplos site.<br /><br />Get your own API key <a href="http://api.plos.org/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;">here</span></a>.
