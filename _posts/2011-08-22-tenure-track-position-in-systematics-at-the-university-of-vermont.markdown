Below is the announcement, and see the <a href="http://currentecology.blogspot.com/2011/08/tenure-track-position-in-systematics-at.html">original post</a> at the <a href="http://currentecology.blogspot.com/">Distributed Ecology blog</a>. Why is this related to R? One can do a lot of systematics work in R, including retrieving scientific collections data through an upcoming package handshaking with <a href="http://vertnet.org/index.php">VertNet</a> (part of the <a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a> project), managing large data sets, retrieval of GenBank data through the ape package (see fxn read.genbank), phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis, and more. So I am sure a systematist with R ninja skills will surely have a head up on the rest of the field.&nbsp;</center><center style="text-align: left;"><br /></center><center style="text-align: left;"><br /></center><center><b><br /></b></center><center><b>Assistant Professor in Systematics</b></center><br /><br />Department of Biology<br />University of Vermont<br />Burlington, Vermont<br /><br />The Department of Biology of the University of Vermont seeks applications for a tenure- track Assistant Professor position in Systematics and Evolutionary Biology of arthropods, especially insects.
