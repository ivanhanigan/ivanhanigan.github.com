Crowdsourced funding is becoming a sustainable way for various artists, entrepreneurs, etc. to get their idea funded from individuals. For example, think of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="http://www.rockethub.com/">RocketHub</a>.<br /><br /><br />Jai Ranganathan and Jarrett Byrnes have started an experiment to determine how well crowdfunding can work for scientists: The SciFund Challenge. Go here to <a href="http://scifund.wordpress.com/sign-up/">signup</a> and here for their <a href="http://scifund.wordpress.com/">website</a>. <br /><br /><br />The deadline to sign up is Oct. 1
