<a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/">Carl Boettiger</a>, a graduate student at UC Davis, just got two packages on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">CRAN</a>. &nbsp;One is <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/treebase/index.html">treebase</a>, which which handshakes with the <a href="http://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html">Treebase</a> API. &nbsp;The other is <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rfishbase/index.html">rfishbase</a>, which connects with the <a href="http://www.fishbase.org/search.php">Fishbase</a>, although I believe just scrapes XML content as there is no API. &nbsp;See development on GitHub for treebase <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/treeBASE">here</a>, and for rfishbase <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase">here</a>. &nbsp;Carl has some tutorials on treebase and rfishbase at his website <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/">here</a>, and we have an official rOpenSci tutorial for treebase <a href="http://ropensci.org/tutorials/r-treebase-tutorial/">here</a>.<br /><br />Basically, these two R packages let you search and pull down data from Treebase and Fishbase - pretty awesome. &nbsp;This improves workflow, and puts your data search and acquisition component into your code, instead of being a bunch of mouse clicks in a browser.<br /><br />These two packages are part of the <a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci project</a>.
