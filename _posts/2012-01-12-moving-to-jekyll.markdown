I have decided to start my website and blog on Jekyll on the basis that Scott Chamberlain has posted this blog on his move from Blogger and Wordpress to Jekyll.

<http://schamberlain.github.com/2012/01/moving-from-blogger-wordpress-to-jekyll/>

I am especially enticed by Scott's statements:

"What is the most important thing about science? That it is reproducible of course. Documenting your code and sharing with everyone on GitHub or SVN, etc. is great for science in facilitating collaboration and facilitating transparency. "

and

"it is nice for scientists to use this workflow all the time."

and

"Look for your favorite, and git clone it. Edit the template you have cloned, and commit and push to GitHub"

So I have simply cloned Scott's website and started changing the content to my own.  

Hoping to find all the pieces of the puzzle in the next few weeks and have the conversion completed as soon as possible.  Then I'll try to resist the temptation to tweak the colour schemes endlessly and just keep my focus on the scientific research at hand! Disentangle Things!

Thanks Scott!
