I have decided to start my website and blog on Jekyll on the basis that Scott Chamberlain has posted this blog on his move from Blogger and Wordpress to Jekyll.

http://schamberlain.github.com/2012/01/moving-from-blogger-wordpress-to-jekyll/

I especially enticed by Scott's statements:

"What is the most important thing about science? That it is reproducible of course. Documenting your code and sharing with everyone on GitHub or SVN, etc. is great for science in facilitating collaboration and facilitating transparency. "

and

"it is nice for scientists to use this workflow all the time."
