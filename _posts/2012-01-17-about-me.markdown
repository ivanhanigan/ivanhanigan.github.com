About Me

I am a data manager and analyst at NCEPH <http://nceph.anu.edu.au/> at the Australian National University. I am also undertaking a multi-disciplinary PhD, on a part time basis.

My research focus is on linking population, health and environmental data for epidemiological analysis.

I apply integrative techniques to analysis of environmental health issues such as:
1 Suicide and Drought
2 Air pollution, weather and mortality or morbidity
3 Aeroallergens
4 and more.

This blog reflects my work on these various analyses, and the tools and techniques I apply there.  
It is called Disentangle Things as both a description of what I try to do (disentangle is subtly different from untangle - more on this later) and also an exhortation.

So let's Disentangle Things!
