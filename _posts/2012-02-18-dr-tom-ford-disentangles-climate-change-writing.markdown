# Climate change and contemporary fiction 

Dr Tom Ford [blogs] [1] about how climate and climate change are entangled in contemporary fiction. For a social scientist he does a really good job of disentangling esoteric and specialist environmental science knowledge with sliterary waffle and voodoo. Is this a whole new category of post modern and existentialist?
