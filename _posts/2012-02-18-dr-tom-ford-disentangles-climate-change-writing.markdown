# Climate change and contemporary fiction 

My friend Dr Tom Ford [blogs] [1] about how climate and climate change are entangled in contemporary fiction. For a social scientist he does a really good job of disentangling esoteric and specialist environmental science knowledge with literary waffle and voodoo (sorry, that's an in-joke... I consider my self a waffly exponent of enviro voodoo too - but more than happy to cast aspersions and sling defamatory insults around). 

Tom's bag as far as I can tell is to reflect on the creation and development of literary constructs used by writers to talk about climate, and climate change. Is this a whole new category of post modern and existentialist literature?
