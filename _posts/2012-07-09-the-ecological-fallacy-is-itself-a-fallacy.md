The Ecological Fallacy
----

The term 'Ecological fallacy' is used in Epidemiology and some other disciplines (such as Sociology) to refer to [improperly inferring a causal association (or lack of association) at an individual-level based on a group-level relationship] [1]. This use of the word ecological is at odds with the alternative use of the word in the discipline of Ecology.  [Ecological methods from Ecology are inherently multi-scaled] [2] and address precisely the issue of this cross-scale inferential fallacy.
