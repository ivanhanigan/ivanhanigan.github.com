The Ecological Fallacy
----

The term 'Ecological fallacy' is used in Epidemiology and some other disciplines (such as Sociology) to refer to [improperly inferring a causal association (or lack of association) at an individual-level based on a group-level relationship] [1]. This use of the word ecological is at odds with the alternative use of the word in the discipline of Ecology.  [Ecological methods from Ecology are inherently multi-scaled] [2] and address precisely the issue of this cross-scale inferential fallacy.  

I argue that a broader understanding of ecological methods by non-Ecologists would be a start towards better understanding between the disciplines.  The inclusion of real ecological methods in the other disciplines will also assist research to better understand the causes and effects of climate and climate change which are important gaps in knowledge needed to enable mitigation and adaptation of our society to future climate change.  

To clear up this confusion it is necessary to go back to the source of the use of the term 'ecological' by the urban sociologist Amos Hawley who used the term 'human ecology' in the 1950s to build on the theoretical traditions of [Robert Parke and E. W. Burgess at the University of Chicago in the 1920s on the structure and development of cities] [3]. His influence in the Social Sciences led directly to the development a tradition of social human ecology, one largely without a bio-physical environment.  The usage of 'ecological' to mean multivariate studies of complex systems stems from the sociological tradition.
