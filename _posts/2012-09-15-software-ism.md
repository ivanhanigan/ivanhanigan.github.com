I am a huge fan of the R language for statistics and graphics.

I sometimes hear people say they don't like R but then admit that they have never tried to use it, or if they have it was close to ten years ago (and a lot has changed).

I think that multi-disciplinary work will inevitably mean we find a mix of software in use, and they'll all have strenghts and weakndess.

But it seems like we get a bit predujiced against software that we don't use.

I hope we can work toward a kind of 'tower of babel'.

For all the R doubters out there I encourage you to have a go.  Especially have a try of the recent developments in Rstudio like this 'R Markdown document'. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:





You can also embed plots, for example:
