Many examples are emerging of scientists who are transitioning to a
much more open model of research.  This is in part externally driven
by funding bodies (such as the Aussie Research Council asking for deposit of funded data and papers) and journals
([ie. Nature journals removing length restrictions on Methods sections.](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n5/full/ng.2621.html)). Also the increased value being placed on transparency of reproducible analysis to safeguard against error and fraud is becoming an internal driver within science communities.

[Open Notebook Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Notebook_Science)
(ONS) style is an extreme of transparent approaches to research.
According to the wikipedia page it is the "practice of making the
entire primary record of a research project publicly available online
as it is recorded".  

That's pretty extreme!  In my view a lot of stuff in the research project should probably be archived quickly and left to rot.

I like the range of options available.  I think I'll go for [SCD or "Seclected Content / Delayed"](http://onsclaims.wikispaces.com/) and show their image below.  In this model a portion of the open notebook and associated supporting raw data are available after some delay. I'll try to use this blog for weekly updates on progress for each project, and provide links off my 'Research Notebook' and 'Software' Tabs.
