    <h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>I was grateful to recieve the <a href="http://students.anu.edu.au/scholarships/gc/cur/dom/bhati.php">Bhati Family Travel Grant</a> which allowed me to travel to Chennai, India in October to meet with experts on Drought and Suicide there.  I wanted to go to India to help me with my work on <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/35/13950">Farmer Suicide in Australia</a> primarily because I'd read about the excellent researchers there and also the large magnitude of the problem with farmer suicide and drought (it is in the news media quite regularly).</p>

<!-- Secondarily, I wanted to come back because I'd visited in 2005 for 3 weeks and was overwhelmed by the experience, possibly we tried to do to much and also we were mostly on the busy tourist track.  I wanted to see if a more local approach might give me a better experience of India.
-->


<p>I arrived on 2nd October and the airport and streets were pretty quiet.  I think because this is a public holiday in honour of Gandhi.</p>

<p>I had previously arranged to meet</p>

<ul>
<li>Dr L Vijayakumar founder of <a href="http://snehaindia.org/">Society for Natal Effects on Health - SNEHA</a> and</li>
<li>Dr A Nambi+, Director of the Climate Change Program and Dr R Rukmani, Director of the Food Security Program at <a href="http://www.mssrf.org/">M S Swaminathan Research Foundation - MSSRF</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is my re-written notes of both meetings.</p>

<h4>First Meeting: 3rd October, Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar</h4>

<p>Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar is a WHO expert, a practicing psychiatrist and founder of the SNEHA suicide prevention organisation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sneha-ad.jpg" alt="sneha-ad.jpg" /></p>

<p>When I contacted her to ask for a meeting she invited me to come to the headquarters of SNEHA in R A Puram, south central Chennai. The Autorickshaw driver took a couple of wrong turns but we got there OK after asking directions.  I also met Jyothi the SNEHA Director and several volunteers who work at the centre and befriend people who visit or phone with suicidal problems.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sneha-cropped.jpg" alt="sneha-cropped.jpg" /></p>

<!-- We met at 12 noon and we also had Dosai for lunch. -->


<!-- With us were Jyothi, Sumitra and a volunteer whose name I did not write down -->


<p>I had asked to visit because I've been following her research on farmer suicide prevention measures.  I suggested that my research on Drought-specific causality might benefit from insights that Dr Vijayakumar could give me, and thankfully she agreed to give me her time. I was very pleased she mentioned that she found my research "interesting and important" which is great because that is just the way I feel about HER research.</p>

<p>I reflected on my way to the meeting what I want to get out of this lesson and I felt that it was really important to get feedback on some of the directions I want to pursue in terms of a unified theoretical framework across environmental and social causes of suicide (generalised across diverse social situations like the differences between Australian and Indian Farmers).</p>

<p>I also felt it was important that I might just sit and listen to any advice Dr Vijayakumar felt like giving me, so I asked what she thought were the most important priorities for farmer suicide research in India.
I have been reflecting on the influence of Dr Vijayakumar's words had on me when I heard them on a Radio report by Australian Journalist Michael Condon <a href="www.google.com">Ref</a> when he came to India in 2009.</p>

<h4>My Secret Agenda</h4>

<p>I brought along a secret agenda which was to get an opinion of my preconceived thoughts about the topic.  Particularly the approach to a generalised framework of the work of my PhD supervisors Colin, Phil and Rohan for disentangling environmental from social impacts on health.  Especially this framework is for understanding tipping points in the farmer suicide system.  My second secret agenda was that if the framework I presented was thought OK, then what were the best next steps (plan for the future), in terms of communication in suicide prevention fields, actions in policy arenas and etc.</p>

<p>First: I presented the general framework.  The essence of this is the "Five Capitals":
- Financial
- Social
- Physical
- Natural
- Human</p>

<p>Phil and Rohan have developed approaches aimed at Rural Livelihoods and Adaptive Capacity of Farmers.  Colin had extended this even to the concept of Human Carrying Capacity.  I think this framework especially useful for tipping points because the causes of such catastrophes are undoubtedly numerous, interacting and dynamic.</p>

<p>So what did Lakshmi think?  She started by saying that it made good sense, that the main focus of suicide prevention work was focused on the biological, psychological and social domains.  But there are so many other factors.  Drought was clearly one.</p>

<p>She got out a map of the recent suicide rates and showed me a region of elevated risk north-west of Tamil Nadu, south of Chatinargarth, and north of Kerala.  60 percent of India's farmer suicides are in these states.  Why are these 3 states high but TN is not?  All are semi-arid.</p>

<!-- TODO check this -->


<p>All have similar societies, cultures, climates, agriculture, etc.  We tried fitting these to the five capitals framework.</p>

<!--
#### What do you think?
Dr Lakshmi said that this kind of thing did help to develop policy "definitely".
I asked how much extra help this gave if we knew that pesticides, alcohol and gun control were so important.  She replied that those were medium term policy solutions but long-term policies needed to look at social dynamics, farming and a whole lot of things like status change (owning land used to be a status symbol but now is a burden).

#### What are the priorities?
What secondary (surrogate) priorities emerge around the main points?  If I bring questions to the lesson are they answered by the presenter?  If not why?

- Synthesis:
My new understanding of the topic.

- TODO Mind map of the pathway to completed suicide.
