    <p>My name is Ivan Hanigan.   I am a PhD student in the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (NCEPH) at the Australian National University (ANU).</p>
    <p>I am a multidisciplinary data manager and analyst with over
10 years experience at one of Australia's leading universities. I have
primarily worked in Environmental Epidemiology where I have honed my
skills in manipulation of large databases and multivariate regression
modelling.  I also have experience of
scenario-based forecasting in climate change risk assessments.
    </p>
    <p>
I have been the lead author on four papers in international journals,
and contributing author on numerous journal papers, reports and
conference presentations.
    </p>
    <p>
I have used the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)
international standard for metadata since 2009 to ensure
the data management system is suitably documented and maintained
throughout the Data Analysis Lifecycle.  
    </p>
    <p>
My programming expertise is primarily with the R language for statistical computing
and graphics but I also am adept programming and configuring Postgres, PostGIS, Geoserver, QGIS, ArcGIS, Stata, SPSS, Oracle-XE, Linux (Ubuntu, Centos, RHEL).
