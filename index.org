I am a Data Scientist at the University of Canberra.  I am about to submit my PhD at the ANU.   I work on data  analysis that disentangles health effects of environmental changes from social factors.  I give special attention to issues of data security, privacy and ethics, with my research into climate-suicide relationships as a key motivating use-case.

Ivan Hanigan is a Data Scientist specialising in epidemiology. From 2001 to 2013 he worked with the Climate Change and Health programme at ANU. In 2014 he led the development of the data portal for the Australian Long Term Ecological Research Network. Ivan works on data analysis that attempts to disentangle health effects of environmental changes from social factors. He gives special attention to issues of data management, security, privacy and ethics, with research into climate and mental health as a key motivating use-case.

Ivan has primarily worked in environmental epidemiology, building on the systems approach of human ecology. He applies techniques such as reproducible research, integration of heterogeneous datasets and statistical modelling of exposure-response associations in the context of complex multifactorial causality. The conceptual framework used for integrating these data incorporates the idea of five interacting 'capitals'. This approach is used to explore a range of topics from estimating differential vulnerability across sub-populations, precision of spatio-temporal exposure estimates and general issues of geographical data analysis methods in this context.

Ivan's work has spanned the range from designing study protocols, creating datasets, conducting analyses and communicating results. The integration of gridded, point-source and area-based administrative data is a specialty. In particular he has experience in the integration of health, social and environmental data which involves reconciling health and socio-economic or population data based on incompatible spatial units. Ivan is also adept at the creation of linked environmental exposure maps and computer programming. Alongside his experience in analysis of empirical data he has experience in scenario-based forecasting in climate change risk assessments.

Health and wellbeing throughout the lifespan:

Ivan investigates the environmental and social determinants of health across the lifespan, especially factors that are involved in causing eco-social tipping points.  These include extreme weather events such as droughts, bushfires, woodsmoke, duststorms, and heat-waves. Vulnerability varies across different subgroups of people, in different regions and stages of their lives.  Ivan has investigated outcomes such as cardiorespiratory disease, depression, suicide and infectious diseases.  Environmental exposures should be explored in the context of many other variables that comprise the biological and socioeconomic milieu. His research uses data science to apply methods that utilise an eco-social framework. Careful application of data mining tools is required as it is likely to lead to substantially more diverse ranges of inputs to analyses.  Eco-social research therefore relies on the strong foundations of causal inference from epidemiology to ensure that any novel findings from these complicated studies avoid risks of interpreting fallacious associations as causal relationships.

## Summary

### Biography

I am a multidisciplinary data manager and analyst with over 15 years experience at seven Australian universities and the CSIRO, especially the ANU. I am currently a Data Scientist at the University of Canberra Health Research Institute. I recently submitted my PhD at the ANU.  Until 2013 I worked closely with Tony McMichael's Climate Change and Health programme at ANU. In 2014/15 I led the development of the data portal for the Long Term Ecological Research Network.  I work on data analysis that disentangles health effects of environmental changes from social factors. I give special attention to issues of data management, security, privacy and ethics, with my research into climate and mental health as a key motivating use-case.  
<p></p>
I have primarily worked in environmental epidemiology, building on the systems approach I gained from my undergraduate training in human ecology at ANU.  My PhD research focused on reproducible research pipelines, integration of heterogeneous datasets and statistical modelling of exposure-response associations in the context of complex multifactorial causality.  My studies include phenomena such as the effects of drought and extreme heat on mental health. The conceptual framework I used for integrating these data incorporates the idea of five interacting 'capitals' and I explored the areas of differential vulnerability across sub-populations, precision of spatio-temporal exposure estimates and general issues of geospatial data analysis methods.
<p></p>
I have been both lead author and contributing author on 22 peer-reviewed journal papers. I have contributed to 6 reports and 14 conference presentations. My Scopus h-index is 11. My contributions have spanned the range from designing study protocols, creating datasets, conducting analyses and communicating results. The integration of gridded, point-source and area-based administrative data has become a speciality. In particular I have experience in the integration of health, social and environmental data which involves reconciling health and socio-economic or population data based on incompatible spatial units.  I also am adept at the creation of linked environmental exposure maps and computer programming. Alongside my experience in analysis of empirical data I have experience in scenario-based forecasting in climate change risk assessments.

### Auditing and inventorising

- I just completed an audit of my project files and updated the list on my website [http://ivanhanigan.github.com/projects.html](/projects.html)
- This was enabled by the work I have been doing on a data inventory web2py app [https://github.com/ivanhanigan/data_inventory](https://github.com/ivanhanigan/data_inventory) 
- The list shows some of the project data collections I have amassed during my research over the last 15 years
- Some of these are data collections I have developed, others are derivatives of collections originated by others
- Many of these are areas of active research, but others are dormant
- This list will be updated as time permits.

I've just come out of an amazing 5 day conference on One Health (where animal health science meets human health science, and a whole lot of ecological thinking).

It was truly terrifying to hear about the cascading risks to health from environmental change.  I was deeply affected by the story of monitoring worm infestation rates in children working in mines in the DRCongo, and saddened by the mass death of coral this year on the barrier reef (among many other tragic stories). 

There was good news too:

- Pepper and cinnamon fed to broiler chickens in India has been found to have antimicrobial properties 
- Bhutan have made progress with rabies
- Yanks working with Ozzies are making progress on Hendra antibodies/vaccine for horses and humans 
- I met some very inspiring early career researchers and students 
- I met some equally inspiring senior scientists
- My drought index/Government Drought Declarations poster was viewed by the former head of the Gov. Department who was in charge of the drought declarations (we agreed that the underlying governmental decision rules are vague and multipurpose, and a climate index has great value when looking at human ecology)  
    
I also gathered some AVA CPD points (whatever they are!) as alerted by this certificate they sent me.
