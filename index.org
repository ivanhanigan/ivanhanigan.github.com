### Auditing and inventorising

- I just completed an audit of my project files and updated the list on my website [http://ivanhanigan.github.com/projects.html](/projects.html)
- This was enabled by the work I have been doing on a data inventory web2py app [https://github.com/ivanhanigan/data_inventory](https://github.com/ivanhanigan/data_inventory) 
- The list shows some of the project data collections I have amassed during my research over the last 15 years
- Some of these are data collections I have developed, others are derivatives of collections originated by others
- Many of these are areas of active research, but others are dormant
- This list will be updated as time permits.
