I am a huge fan of the R language for statistics and graphics.

I sometimes hear people say they don't like R but then admit that they have never tried to use it, or if they have it was close to ten years ago (and a lot has changed).

In recent discussions at work I got the impression some people have got a bit predjudiced against R and other software that they don't actually use, primarily because of the added difficulty of software that requires a bit of programming.

I think that multi-disciplinary work will inevitably mean we find a mix of software in use, and they'll all have strengths and weaknesses.  A major strength of R is that one can weave together a report that includes the data, code, graphs and interpretations for an analysis, rather than copy-and-pasting these elements together as is required with other software toolboxes.

For example a simple analysis in Rstudio using the 'R Markdown document' is below. 

You can load and explore data in the document by placing 'Code Chunks' in the document, then when you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#+end_src

*** code
#+name:asdf
#+begin_src markdown :session *R* :tangle _posts/2012-09-15-software-ism.md :exports code :eval yes

You can also embed plots, for example:
#+end_src
*** code
#+name:asdf
#+begin_src markdown :session *R* :tangle _posts/2012-09-15-software-ism.md :exports code :eval no

I hope we can work toward a kind of 'tower of babel'.

In the [GIS forum SPDEP study group](http://gis-forum.github.io/study.html) we've been discussing the Bluetongue paper [http://www.mendeley.com/research/why-did-bluetongue-spread-the-way-it-did](http://www.mendeley.com/research/why-did-bluetongue-spread-the-way-it-did-environmental-factors-influencing-the-velocity-of-blueton)

I'd like to know more about the the Lagrange Multiplier tests and Francis
raised the [seminal Anselin 1988 paper for that](http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2013/04/reflections-bob-haining/#comment-864167749)


But in this post I just wanted to summarise their model selection procedure in a flow diagram

# Animated maps to allow exploration of alternate levels of 'jitter'
In a [previous project](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22672028) we published a map of point locations that had been 'jittered', ie adding random noise to the latitude and longitude.  We did this by testing out a few maps and deciding on one that we thought protected privacy adequately whilst not destroying the spatial pattern we wished to display (evocatively).

I always wondered about a way to interactively do this and I think the animation package might do the trick, with the ability to step thru levels of jittering with the pause, fwd and back buttons.

[Clink here for the same data shown in a new animation](/jitter/index.html).
