    </h1>
    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <p>The other day I reported that I've implemented a new open science task management regime <a href="http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2015/09/task-management-like-an-open-science-hacker/">http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2015/09/task-management-like-an-open-science-hacker/</a>.</p>

<p>This was instigated by my renewed enthusiasm for open science after a few high profile papers have come out in the last few months imploring scientists to take action on shonky statistics and the "morass of poorly conducted data analyses, with errors ranging from trivial and strange to devastating" (Peng 2015) <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2015.00827.x">http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2015.00827.x</a>.</p>

<p>I believe that making ones electronic notebook open is one of the most obvious and easily achieved things to do toward that ambition.  I also think that keeping the TODO-list in the forefront of ones mind and continuously checking things off the list is a great boost for productivity and keeping on track.  This culminates in the advice to keep momentum by doing something toward the plan on a daily basis, no matter how trivial.  This is sometimes called Jerry Seinfeld's secret to productivity: Just keep at it. Don't break the streak. <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2014/10/12/">http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2014/10/12/</a>.</p>

<p>So what was holding me back from a really useful daily publication of my open notebook?  I showed last post how I manage tasks in Emac Orgmode (a task organiser and calendar/agenda rolled up with code execution for running R scripts etc).  I also write my blog posts in orgmode.</p>

<p>The only problem with that set up was that I was still using the code from Charlie Park <a href="http://charliepark.org/jekyll-with-plugins/">http://charliepark.org/jekyll-with-plugins/</a> which adds the inadequate commit description '<code>Latest build</code>' every time.  What I needed was a way to actually log a summary of work each day, so I can look back over the history and know I actually did something everyday and was not just gaming the system by committing random little non-work additions (I want to balance this by doing <em>some</em> work every day, but also take time off to read, exercise, socialize, and generally have fun).</p>

<p>So anyway, the point of this post is to describe my revision to Charlie Park's code for building a jekyll blog:</p>

<h4>Code: put in ~/.bash_profile</h4>

<pre><code>function bb() {
  cd ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com.raw &amp;&amp; jekyll b &amp;&amp; cp -r    
  ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com.raw/_site/* ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com &amp;&amp; 
  cd ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com &amp;&amp; git add . -A  &amp;&amp; 
  git commit -m "$*" &amp;&amp; 
  git push
}
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<ul>
<li>That bit about <code>$*</code> was a bit difficult for me to get working as this is the first time I have written a bash script in anger.  The alternative was to use <code>$1</code> and require the git commit message to be passed within quotes, which also makes sense but I did not do that.</li>
<li>I also needed to change the terminal settings so that it always loads the bash_profile</li>
</ul>


<h4>Bash terminal</h4>

<pre><code>Edit &gt; Profile preferences
Title and Command &gt; Run command as a login shell 
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<ul>
<li>And so now I just have to deposit a markdown blog post into the jekyll <code>_posts</code> folder and then</li>
</ul>


<h4>Bash</h4>

<pre><code>bb Add a meaningful commit message about todays progress
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>There you have it, a meaningful message regarding what I have been doing towards my scientific output every day.</p>

    </h1>
    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <h1>Aims</h1>

<p>I have worked on a function that turns a <code>data.frame</code> into a graphviz code in the dot language, with some of my preferred settings.  I realised that it might be useful for causal directed acyclic graphs.</p>

<p>Causal diagrams are useful for conceptualising the pathways of cause and effect.  These diagrams are sometimes simplly informal pictures but have also been developed in a more formal way to be used in modelling.  These formal developments use concepts derived from the mathmatical abstraction of Graphs (fundamentally Graphs  are networks of linked 'nodes', with the links being termed 'edges').  Causal diagrams can either be constructed to depict two things: first are feedback loops (a vexatious property of complex systems that confounds modelling) while second are more simple chain-of-events type pathways which proceed from an upstream cause to a downstream effect in a single direction, without cycles, called 'Directed Acyclic Graphs or DAGs.  The loop diagrams are out of the scope of this present blog post because the DAGs are much more easily addressed by the tool that I am describing.</p>

<p>To begin I am going to build on this other guy's blog post on causal DAGs with R
  <a href="http://donlelek.github.io/2015/03/31/dags-with-r/">http://donlelek.github.io/2015/03/31/dags-with-r/</a>
I wanted to add an interface for building these.</p>

<p>Some background to the concepts that I use are provided in the references below.</p>

<h1>Materials and Methods</h1>

<p>The DiagrammeR package which has been integrated within R-Studio has made access to the graphing tool <code>graphviz</code> much easier than it used to be.  My function <code>causal_dag</code> (avaiable in my <code>disentangle</code> github package) essentially constructs the required <code>nodes</code> and <code>edges</code> for that package to use.  Optionally we can also include <code>labels</code> to indicate the direction of the effect.</p>

<p>To use the tool all you need to do is create a list of <code>edges</code> and their associated <code>inputs</code> nodes and <code>outputs</code> nodes (as a comma separated values string) shown in the picture below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/causal-ssheet.png" alt="causal-ssheet.png" /></p>

<h4>Code:</h4>

<pre><code># read in the sheet
library(disentangle)
library(stringr)
causes &lt;- readxl::read_excel("causal-ssheet.xlsx")
causes
nodes &lt;- newnode(causes, "edges", "inputs", "outputs")
cat(nodes)
# The result is a formated graph in the dot language with some of my
# preferred settings such as edges showing as 'records' and a spot to
# write a description or include literature about each process
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<ul>
<li>See the DOT code in the Appendix</li>
<li>to render the graph now DiagrammeR can use this text string R object to render this to SVG</li>
<li>I think it does not do PNG or PDF though so I still use graphviz and dot directly</li>
</ul>


<h4>Code:</h4>

<pre><code>grViz(nodes)

# But I also use graphviz directly to produce a publishable image in
# pdf or png
sink("reproduce-donlelek.dot")
cat(nodes)
sink()# If graphviz is installed and on linux call it with a shell command
#system("dot -Tpdf reproduce-donlelek.dot -o reproduce-donlelek.pdf")
system("dot -Tpng reproduce-donlelek.dot -o reproduce-donlelek.png")
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<h1>Results</h1>

<p>Here I have reproduced the work of donlelek</p>

<p><img src="/images/reproduce-donlelek.png" alt="reproduce-donlelek.png" /></p>

<h1>Future directions</h1>

<ul>
<li>I'd like to make the edges implicit, so that the spreadsheet keeps track of the information about the causal process, but the graph just shows the lines connecting the nodes</li>
<li>The edges are where the action is, so I need to add a direction of effect.  This would be in a <code>label</code> column and added in a [ label = 'abc' ] tag for each edge</li>
<li>the rankdir option is LR to make this go sideways, which seems more the norm for causal DAGs, left to right.</li>
</ul>

    </h1>
    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <p>I've learnt this lesson multiple times. It happens like this.  A solution is not immediately obvious in R so you might think of writing your own function.  Generally there is a solution you just did not google enough.
This time I was tricked a little because the GIS functions have been bad for a long time but getting better very rapidly recently.  A little while ago I had a very successful
outcome from using the <code>raster::extract</code> function on a large raster file
to get the attributes for a set of points.  I needed to do the same
thing but this time for a shapefile and points.  I looked at the
raster package and saw you can use the <code>raster::intersect</code> function
here, and it worked on the small sample data I tested with but failed
with the big dataset as it ran out of memory.  I assumed that R had not caught up with the GIS world yet and so I came up with this workaround below by splitting the points data layer into chunks.</p>

<p>I then got access to ArcMap and was wondering whether it could do it, and it DID!
So then I googled a bit and found the solution was simple:</p>

<h4>Code:</h4>

<pre><code>sp::over()
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>Here is my hack in case I ever need to pull out the bit that does the splitting up of the points file, or the tryCatch():</p>

<h4>Code:</h4>

<pre><code>big_pt_intersect &lt;- function(pts, ply, chunks = 100){
  idx &lt;- split(pts@data, 1:chunks)
  #str(idx)
  for(i in 1:length(idx)){
  #i = 1
  print(i)
    ids &lt;- idx[ [i] ][,1]
  #str(pts@data)
  qc &lt;- pts[pts@data[,1] %in% ids,]
  #str(qc)
  tryCatch(
    chunk &lt;-  raster::intersect(qc, ply), 
    error = function(err){print(err)})
  if(!exists('chunk_out')){

    chunk_out &lt;- chunk@data
  } else {
    chunk_out &lt;- rbind(chunk_out, chunk@data)
  }
  rm(chunk)

  }
  #str(chunk_out)
  return(chunk_out)
}
# NB warning about split length multiple is not fatal, just due to nonequal chunks 
# (ie the geocodes are 2009/100)
</code></pre>

<p>I think though that guidelines like the suggestion to copy-paste bits of the manuscript leave a bit to be desired:</p>

<h4>Quote;</h4>

<pre><code>Authors document compliance by copy-pasting the relevant passages
in the paper that address the question into the form. For example,
when indicating how sample size was determined, authors copy paste
into the form the text in the paper that describes how sample size
was determined.
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>Reproducible Research Reports solve this problem by ensuring that the data preparation and analysis are executed in the same script that produces the manuscript, therefore a one-stop-shop for documentation of the entire study.</p>

<h2>There is a need for Templates of Reproducible Research Reports (that look good!)</h2>

<p>Rstudio provides very easy support for these documents if you use R.  In particular the option of a menu button to create a new report populates that report with the required header information and some example script to work off.  But the easiest option does not look so good.  This is the Rmarkdown option and it is very user friendly in terms of the markup language needed to write the descriptive language around your analysis (mostly plain text with a few simple options for heading styles etc) rather than the Sweave option which leads to the full blown LaTeX markup language that is a lot more complicated.</p>

<h4>Boilerplate Rmarkdown header from Rstudio:</h4>

<pre><code>---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Ivan C. Hanigan"
date: "16 September 2015"
output: html_document
---
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>This is great for quick reporting of work as you go, but I  primarily write for output that will be printed (e.g. pdf docs). More specifically, I need the concept of a page, and to have full control over the placement of table and figure ‘environments’, stuff that is easy in LaTeX (once you figure out some of the esoteric parts of that language).</p>

<p>To achieve a simple writing environment in Markdown but with the powerful layout options of LaTeX I reviewed this guys work but I think it takes it to an uneccessary level of complicated-ness
<a href="https://github.com/jhollist/manuscriptPackage">https://github.com/jhollist/manuscriptPackage</a>.</p>

<p>So I went back to some of the old Sweave/Latex templates I had put together and ported it into a markdown header.</p>

<h4>Boilerplate Rmarkdown header for pretty report</h4>

<pre><code>---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Ivan C. Hanigan"
date: "16 September 2015"
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{graphicx}
  - \usepackage{fancyhdr} 
  - \pagestyle{fancy} 
  - \usepackage{lastpage}
  - \usepackage{float} 
  - \floatstyle{boxed} 
  - \restylefloat{figure} 
  - \usepackage{url} 
  - \usepackage{color}
  - \lhead{Left Header}
  - \chead{Rmarkdown Rocks}
  - \rhead{\today}
  - \lfoot{Left Footer}
  - \cfoot{Centre Footer}
  - \rfoot{\thepage\ of \pageref{LastPage}}  
output: 
  pdf_document:
    toc: false
documentclass: article
classoption: a4paper
bibliography: references.bib
---
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>Now the layout of tables and figures is done with latex</p>

<h4>Code</h4>

<pre><code>Using the xtable package allows results to be displyed in tables
and has built in support for some R objects, so summrising the
linear fit above in ~\ref{ATable}

```{r, results='asis', type = 'tex'}
library(xtable)    
print(xtable(fit, caption="Example Table",
  digits=4,table.placement="ht",label="ATable"), comment = F)    
```

## A Plot

Plots intergrate most easily if made seperately as can be seen in figure ~\ref{test}
```{r}
png("Rmarkdownfig.png")
plot(x,y,main="Example Plot",xlab="X Variable",ylab="Y Variable")
abline(fit,col="Red")
dev.off()
```
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{Rmarkdownfig.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Some Plot}
\label{test}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>I also realised that if this was to be a full report of a scientific study it would need to include some of the machinery needed for bibliographies.</p>

<h4>Stuff for bibliographies</h4>

<pre><code>```{r, echo=F, results = 'hide', message = F, warning=F}
library("knitcitations")
library("bibtex")
cleanbib()
cite_options(citation_format = "pandoc", check.entries = FALSE)

bib &lt;- read.bibtex("C:/Users/Ivan/Dropbox/references/library.bib")

```

&lt;!--Put data analysis and reporting here, then at the end of the doc--&gt;

```{r, echo=F, message=F, eval=T}
write.bibtex(file="references.bib")
```

# References

&lt;!--The bib will then be written following the final subheading--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope this might help others develop their own templates for RRR that look great.</p>

      <p>I just read this impressive paper and it has really given me a push toward making this open lab notebook</p>

<h4>Quote</h4>

<pre><code>The situation is a classic collective action problem. Many individual researchers lack
strong incentives to be more transparent, even though the credibility of science would 
benefit if everyone were more transparent.
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>So I think I'll try to step up the pace of logging my daily scientific work.
One super easy thing to do is to publish my daily log from my task management in orgmode.
Indeed I am also reading at the moment this guy who says</p>

<p></p>


<p>Finally, I was struck by this reference <a href="http://rich-iannone.github.io/about/2014/10/28/introduction.html">http://rich-iannone.github.io/about/2014/10/28/introduction.html</a> to something about 365+ day GitHub streaks. It was covered earlier by Geoff Greer, and by Dirk Eddelbuettel.</p>

<p>It seems the basic concept is that you can leverage off an obsessive tendency by making sure you do something toward ticking off items from the task list every day.  The impulse to not breaking the chain is supposed to give you inspiration to keep going.  I think this might work well for my temperatment.</p>

<h2>Emacs and orgmode</h2>

<p>The set up of my daily log is pretty simple. After being set up by kjhealy's starter kit.
Then I modified the org-agenda-files which was set in the main el file that kjhealy provided  and then with the command C-c a a emacs will display my calendar.</p>

<p>When I open emacs in the morning I  open the agenda and this also opens research-log file.  I move to that buffer, then I use this key command to insert a new entry for todays date</p>

<h4>CODE</h4>

<pre><code> (define-skeleton org-journalentry
   "Template for a journal entry."
   "project:"
   "*** " (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %a") " \n"
   "**** TODO-list \n"
   "***** TODO \n"
   "**** timesheet\n"
   "#+begin_src txt :tangle work-log.csv :eval no :padline no\n"
   (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %a") ", " str ", 50\n" 
   "#+end_src\n"
 )
 (global-set-key [C-S-f5] 'org-journalentry)
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>This creates a new date, a stub of a TODO for anything ad hoc and a entry into my timesheet.csv file.</p>

<p>I then select from TODO items from a global list that I keep at the top of the file, and cut/paste them into todays list.</p>

<p><img src="/images/agenda.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Great so I just moved this research-log orgmode file into my blog github repo, and with the help of charlie park's bash script I am good to go</p>

<h4>CODE</h4>

<pre><code>alias build_blog="cd ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com.raw; jekyll b;
cp -r ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com.raw/_site/* ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com;
cd ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com;git add .;git commit -am 'Latest build.';git push"
alias bb="build_blog"
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>So this will put the resulting changes onto my open lab book website here <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanhanigan/ivanhanigan.github.com/master/work-log.org">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanhanigan/ivanhanigan.github.com/master/work-log.org</a></p>

<p>Things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>I found this list of tips <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/streak-github-mistakes/">http://natashatherobot.com/streak-github-mistakes/</a></li>
<li>In particular I realise I need to make my daily push by 4:50 PM in Canberra ACT as this is 11:50 PM the previous day for Github, Pacific Time (PT)</li>
<li>I also will need to ensure I don't publish sensitive (or embarrasing entries).</li>
<li>I'll try to keep the identity of my collaborators private as well, so just use their initials rather than names.</li>
</ul>
