</ul>


<p>This is my re-written notes of both meetings.</p>

<h4>First Meeting: 3rd October, Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar</h4>

<p>Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar is a WHO expert, a practicing psychiatrist and founder of the SNEHA suicide prevention organisation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sneha-ad.jpg" alt="sneha-ad.jpg" /></p>

<p>When I contacted her to ask for a meeting she invited me to come to the headquarters of SNEHA in R A Puram, south central Chennai. The Autorickshaw driver took a couple of wrong turns but we got there OK after asking directions.  I also met Jyothi the SNEHA Director and several volunteers who work at the centre and befriend people who visit or phone with suicidal problems.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sneha-cropped.jpg" alt="sneha-cropped.jpg" /></p>

<!-- We met at 12 noon and we also had Dosai for lunch. -->


<!-- With us were Jyothi, Sumitra and a volunteer whose name I did not write down -->

>>>>>>> 08a5bb32cb6119bbf5f18a75e1a6d9f46307d601

<p>I had asked to visit because I've been following her research on farmer suicide prevention measures.  I suggested that my research on Drought-specific causality might benefit from insights that Dr Vijayakumar could give me, and thankfully she agreed to give me her time. I was very pleased she mentioned that she found my research "interesting and important" which is great because that is just the way I feel about HER research.</p>

</ul>
=======
<p>I reflected on my way to the meeting what I want to get out of this lesson and I felt that it was really important to get feedback on some of the directions I want to pursue in terms of a unified theoretical framework across environmental and social causes of suicide (generalised across diverse social situations like the differences between Australian and Indian Farmers).</p>

<p>I also felt it was important that I might just sit and listen to any advice Dr Vijayakumar felt like giving me, so I asked what she thought were the most important priorities for farmer suicide research in India.
I have been reflecting on the influence of Dr Vijayakumar's words had on me when I heard them on a Radio report by Australian Journalist Michael Condon <a href="www.google.com">Ref</a> when he came to India in 2009.</p>

<!-- TODO expand this. -->


<h4>My Secret Agenda</h4>

<p>I brought along a secret agenda which was to get an opinion of my preconceived thoughts about the topic.  Particularly the approach to a generalised framework of the work of my PhD supervisors Colin, Phil and Rohan for disentangling environmental from social impacts on health.  Especially this framework is for understanding tipping points in the farmer suicide system.  My second secret agenda was that if the framework I presented was thought OK, then what were the best next steps (plan for the future), in terms of communication in suicide prevention fields, actions in policy arenas and etc.</p>

<p>First: I presented the general framework.  The essence of this is the "Five Capitals":
- Financial
- Social
- Physical
- Natural
- Human</p>

<p>Phil and Rohan have developed approaches aimed at Rural Livelihoods and Adaptive Capacity of Farmers.  Colin had extended this even to the concept of Human Carrying Capacity.  I think this framework especially useful for tipping points because the causes of such catastrophes are undoubtedly numerous, interacting and dynamic.</p>

<p>So what did Lakshmi think?  She started by saying that it made good sense, that the main focus of suicide prevention work was focused on the biological, psychological and social domains.  But there are so many other factors.  Drought was clearly one.</p>

<p>She got out a map of the recent suicide rates and showed me a region of elevated risk north-west of Tamil Nadu, south of Chatinargarth, and north of Kerala.  60 percent of India's farmer suicides are in these states.  Why are these 3 states high but TN is not?  All are semi-arid.</p>

<!-- TODO check this -->


<p>All have similar societies, cultures, climates, agriculture, etc.  We tried fitting these to the five capitals framework.</p>

<!--
#### What do you think?
Dr Lakshmi said that this kind of thing did help to develop policy "definitely".
I asked how much extra help this gave if we knew that pesticides, alcohol and gun control were so important.  She replied that those were medium term policy solutions but long-term policies needed to look at social dynamics, farming and a whole lot of things like status change (owning land used to be a status symbol but now is a burden).

#### What are the priorities?
What secondary (surrogate) priorities emerge around the main points?  If I bring questions to the lesson are they answered by the presenter?  If not why?

- Synthesis:
My new understanding of the topic.

<p>I reflected on my way to the meeting what I want to get out of this lesson and I felt that it was really important to get feedback on some of the directions I want to pursue in terms of a unified theoretical framework across environmental and social causes of suicide (generalised across diverse social situations like the differences between Australian and Indian Farmers).</p>

<p>I also felt it was important that I might just sit and listen to any advice Dr Vijayakumar felt like giving me, so I asked what she thought were the most important priorities for farmer suicide research in India.
I have been reflecting on the influence of Dr Vijayakumar's words had on me when I heard them on a Radio report by Australian Journalist Michael Condon <a href="www.google.com">Ref</a> when he came to India in 2009.</p>

<h4>My Secret Agenda</h4>

<p>I brought along a secret agenda which was to get an opinion of my preconceived thoughts about the topic.  Particularly the approach to a generalised framework of the work of my PhD supervisors Colin, Phil and Rohan for disentangling environmental from social impacts on health.  Especially this framework is for understanding tipping points in the farmer suicide system.  My second secret agenda was that if the framework I presented was thought OK, then what were the best next steps (plan for the future), in terms of communication in suicide prevention fields, actions in policy arenas and etc.</p>

<p>First: I presented the general framework.  The essence of this is the "Five Capitals":
- Financial
- Social
- Physical
- Natural
- Human</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>Phil and Rohan have developed approaches aimed at Rural Livelihoods and Adaptive Capacity of Farmers.  Colin had extended this even to the concept of Human Carrying Capacity.  I think this framework especially useful for tipping points because the causes of such catastrophes are undoubtedly numerous, interacting and dynamic.</p>

<p>So what did Lakshmi think?  She started by saying that it made good sense, that the main focus of suicide prevention work was focused on the biological, psychological and social domains.  But there are so many other factors.  Drought was clearly one.</p>

<p>She got out a map of the recent suicide rates and showed me a region of elevated risk north-west of Tamil Nadu, south of Chatinargarth, and north of Kerala.  60 percent of India's farmer suicides are in these states.  Why are these 3 states high but TN is not?  All are semi-arid.</p>

<!-- TODO check this -->


<p>All have similar societies, cultures, climates, agriculture, etc.  We tried fitting these to the five capitals framework.</p>

<!--
#### What do you think?
Dr Lakshmi said that this kind of thing did help to develop policy "definitely".
I asked how much extra help this gave if we knew that pesticides, alcohol and gun control were so important.  She replied that those were medium term policy solutions but long-term policies needed to look at social dynamics, farming and a whole lot of things like status change (owning land used to be a status symbol but now is a burden).

#### What are the priorities?
What secondary (surrogate) priorities emerge around the main points?  If I bring questions to the lesson are they answered by the presenter?  If not why?

- Synthesis:
My new understanding of the topic.

- TODO Mind map of the pathway to completed suicide.

<h3>Institutional Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The ARC and NHMRC say they are going to require more metadata (and even data deposit)</li>
<li>Restrictions on data access make it necessary to describe at least the metadata around provision agreements, licence, allowable access</li>
<li>A supporting management level who value the metadata as research output (alongside a peer reviewed paper metadata pales in comparison)</li>
<li>My old boss used to say "Work Not Published Is Work Not Done".</li>
</ul>


<h3>This reminds me of Approaches and Barriers to Reproducible Research</h3>

<ul>
<li>In 2011 BiostatMatt (Matt Shotwell) published <a href="http://biostatmatt.com/uploads/shotwell-interface-2011.pdf">a survey of biostatisticians</a>
VUMC Dept. of Biostatistics to assess:</li>
<li>the prevalence of fully scripted data analyses</li>
<li>the prevalence of literate programming practices</li>
</ul>


<p>To assess the perceived barriers to reproducible research the also asked:</p>

<pre><code>What The biggest obstacle to always reproducibly scripting your work?
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<pre><code>| Barrier                                                  | Staff | Faculty |

| It makes collaboration difficult (eg. file compatibility)|     4 |       2 |
| The software I use doesnt facilitate reproducibility.    |     0 |       0 |
| Its not always necessary for my work to be reproducible. |     2 |       0 |

|----------------------------------------------------------+-------+---------|
</code></pre>

<h3>So what about the Approaches and Barriers to Me Writing Metadata?</h3>

<p>With a sample size of one I asked myself these questions:</p>

<pre><code>| Q                                                  | A                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Do I fully document data (to a metadata standard?) | Occasionally, using DDI for high value raw inputs and final products |
| Do I employ data documentation practices           | I use a tool I created to write minimal metadata occasionally        |
| What are the main barriers?                        | takes more time, The software doesnt facilitate, not always necessary|
</code></pre>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<ul>
<li>The tools need to help write metadata

<ul>
<li>the Institution needs to require metadata</li>
</ul>
