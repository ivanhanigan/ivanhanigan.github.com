    </h1>
    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I've been thinking alot about workflows recently.  I'm talking about the data, code, decisions etc bound up in the flow of material going through any project in the collective program of work we have going on at the Centre I work at.
The group are facing tough questions about how we do things; and why.  So in my reflections I've reviewed some links I'd saved and present below a unified summary version called the...</p>

<h2>Shane-Weiss-Reich-White.worg approach </h2>

<p>This a synthesis I've put together of approaches to managing code in complex data analysis projects. It's named after key exponents on various blogs, wikis and web Q-and-A sites.</p>

<p>Stackoverflow user <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/163053/shane" title="Shane">Shane</a> posted <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2292913" title="Shane's Post">this excellent comment to stackoverflow</a> to:</p>

<p>"start off with one R file as you start a project (or a set of files like in the <a href="https://github.com/berndweiss" title="Bernd Weiss">Bernd Weiss</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/136862/josh-reich" title="Josh Reich">Josh Reich</a> examples), and progressively add to it (so that it grows in size) as you make discoveries."</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/berndweiss" title="Bernd Weiss">Bernd Weiss'</a> projects have:</p>

<ul>
<li>analysis,</li>
<li>data and</li>
<li>document directories and</li>
<li>README.org (an Emacs org-mode file).</li>
</ul>


<p>Bernd and Jeromy Anglim had an interesting discussion about this workflow in <a href="http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/4506" title="Bernd and Jeromy discuss the Weiss approach on stackexchange">this post at stackexchange</a>.  Especially note that Bernd recommends that every publication, presentation or semester/class etc. has its own git repository.  BUT that "there is one real downside: using the same dataset in different publications means to maintain different versions of 'initialization code' (define missing values, generate new variables etc.). To overcome this problem, Bernd decided to maintain ONE study/dataset-related repository which contains the original init-file. For each publication, presentation etc. use a copy of the original data-file as well as of the init-file (in R via file.copy()). Of course, whenever you create a new variable you'll need to modify the original init-file and do a file.copy() (which is the most annoying part of the approach)."</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/136862/josh-reich" title="Josh Reich">Josh Reich</a> breaks projects into 4 pieces:</p>

<ul>
<li>load.R,</li>
<li>clean.R,</li>
<li>func.R and</li>
<li>do.R</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/about/" title="John Myles White">John Myles White's</a> leads the <a href="http://projecttemplate.net/architecture.html" title="ProjectTemplate">ProjectTemplate</a> package that has 'create.project(minimal = TRUE)' which creates the layout:</p>

<ul>
<li>cache,</li>
<li>config,</li>
<li>data,</li>
<li>munge,</li>
<li>src, and</li>
<li>README</li>
</ul>


<p>I've just added reports.  If a project is a little bit bigger than minimal I'll add admin, metadata, versions etc etc. I contributed that idea to the ProjectTemplate discussion list... but those guys seem to mostly use the default minimal = FALSE which creates all the possible directories including reports.  I'll try to keep it simple and just bolt on whatever bits suit my needs as I go.</p>

<h2>Which Code Editor is the Best?</h2>

<p>And finally the meta work holding the project together is the code editor.  Despite the old joke which describes Emacs as <a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2008/10/from_Vim_to_Emacs_-_part_1/" title="Why Emacs">"a great operating system, lacking only a decent editor"</a>, this editor has killer functions for managing code.  Check out <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/" title="worg">worg the Emacs Org-Mode Community</a>. Recently proponents of worg wrote <a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v46/i03/paper" title="Orgmode takes over the data analysis world">this article</a>.  Previously I've REALLY enjoyed <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/npptor/" title="NPPtoR">NPPtoR</a> (only available under windoof).</p>

<p>In the words of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/37751/jd-long" title="JD Long">JD Long</a> in response to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2292913" title="Shane's Post">Shane</a> "The choice of the specific tool is more idiosyncratic and not near as important as using SOMETHING."</p>

    </h1>
    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In a <a href="http://ivanhanigan.github.com/2012/02/the-organisation-of-material/" title="The Organisation of Material">previous post</a> I talked about the conceptual framework I draw on for organising material about complex systems. I quoted a passage by Koestler 1967 that talks about the writing process describing the use of 'outlines', albeit without using that term.  I find this quote particularly inspires me to think about how to select the material for inclusion (and identify the material ruled out of scope - those times we decide to "chop off entire flowering branches from the tree and start growing them afresh").</p>

<h2>A way to organise</h2>

<p>Outlines are a method for writing, and also the basis of a toolbox called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner" title="Wikipedia Outliners">'outliners'</a>. I've been using the excellent free outliner <a href="http://code.google.com/p/keynote-nf/" title="Keynote-NF">Keynote-NF</a> for years and it has been great.  Recently I was inspired by this <a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v46/i03/" title="jstatsoft">paper by Schulte et al</a>, which very convincingly introduced me to Emacs Orgmode as a viable tool for someone without a computer science background (others had described Emacs as 'not an editor so much as a lifestyle choice' or 'a good operating system just lacking a decent editor').</p>

<h2>A way to think</h2>

<p>I recently had the privilege to attend a class with renowned epidemiologist Professor Nancy Krieger who gave us a valuable insight to her workflow.  She told us that for years she'd started every research project by writing out the outline and then filled out the branches much as Koestler's quote described.  Prof Krieger then said that she didn't explicitly write outlines anymore, she'd been doing it for so long it was deeply ingrained and natural part of her way of thinking.</p>

<p>Prof Krieger went on to describe how she conducts her research workflow through the outline</p>

<ul>
<li>first sketch the outline suggested by the hypotheses to be tested (data sourced,  methods applied)</li>
<li>review the literature, there are very few areas of study that haven't been looked at by someone else</li>
<li>create empty 'table shells' showing the form that the information will be presented in the final paper</li>
<li>exploratory data analysis and graphics</li>
<li>primary data analysis and interpretation of the results</li>
<li>another literature review - identify the dominant story people are telling about this question</li>
<li>write the discussion. Deal with any caveats head-on, how the bias may inflate or deflate estimates</li>
</ul>


<h2>Writing workflow depends on forum</h2>

<p>The flow of steps described above remind me <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/05/my_new_writing/" title="Andrew Gelman's New Writing">Andrew Gelman's point</a> about how he writes science papers like this, but doesn't write blogs this way... he mentions thoughts on style, audience etc.  There may be a dichotomy worth exploring between clear structure vs evolving narrative.</p>

<h2>Key features of outliner software</h2>

<p>To conclude I'll just mention the most interesting features I've found in outliner software and will discuss these in a future post:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nodes: these are the building blocks</li>
<li>Parents and children: there is a strict ordering of the nodes into a hierarchy</li>
<li><a href="http://www.patternlanguage.com/archives/alexander1.htm" title="A City is not a Tree">Semilattice:</a> this allows connections to be made across branches, not just through the hierarchy</li>
<li>Folding can be used to hide entire sections of the tree, unfolding to 'drill down' to deep levels</li>
<li>Hoisting: to promote and demote branches, including all children branches</li>
<li>Lifting and grafting: easy reshuffling of the order</li>
<li>Checked nodes: chosen nodes can be exported while the rest remain invisible</li>
</ul>

      <h1>Climate change and contemporary fiction</h1>

<p>My friend Dr Tom Ford <a href="http://climatechangefiction.blogspot.com.au" title="Climate Change and Contemporary Fiction">blogs</a> about how climate and climate change are entangled in contemporary fiction. For a social scientist he does a really good job of disentangling esoteric and specialist environmental science knowledge with literary waffle and voodoo (sorry, that's an in-joke... I consider my self a waffly exponent of enviro voodoo too - but more than happy to cast aspersions and sling defamatory insults around).</p>

<p>Tom's bag as far as I can tell is to reflect on the creation and development of literary constructs used by writers to talk about climate, and climate change. Is this a whole new category of post modern and existentialist literature?</p>

    </h1>
    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <p>During the course of my research I have repeatedly found the organisation of material to be a challenge (I'm talking about the code, data, text and everything else related to analyses).  One of the things I often struggle with is just keeping my thoughts clear and consistent between projects, through weeks and across years.  I'll try to blog about how I have decided to manage my work, and the tools I have tried and end up using.</p>

<p>To start with, I'd like to share a passage taken from pages 55-57 of Arthur Koestler's "The Ghost in the Machine", 1967, London, Pan Books, with some rephrasing of my own.</p>

<p>"The vexed problem of the 'organisation of material'; vexed because the different aspects of the problem, the welter of evidence and the welter of interpretations, are all interconnected like threads in a Persian carpet. The author is keenly aware of the pattern they form; but how can he convey that pattern if he has to unpick the threads in order to explain them one at a time? Here the problem of temporal order begins to intrude, although his mind may still be functioning in the partly or wholly non-verbal regions of images and intimations.</p>

<p>At last he arrives at a tentative arrangement of his material, under a series of headings and sub-headings, which he shuffles about as if they were compact building blocks. They are probably each represented by a mere jotted key-word....</p>

<p>...now the time has come for these intentional seeds to start growing into saplings which will branch out into sections, sub-sections, and so on: the selection of evidence to be quoted, of illustrations, comment and anecdotes, each of them necessitating further strategic choices. At each node - branching point - of the growing tree, more details are filled in, until at last the syntactic level is reached, the phrase generating machine takes over, the individual words are lined up - some effortlessly, some after a painful search, and are finally transformed into patterns of contractions of finger muscles guiding a pen: the logos has become incarnate.</p>

<p>But of course the process is never quite as neat and orderly as that; trees do not grow in this rigidly symmetrical way. In our schematised account, the selection of the actual words occurs only at an advanced stage of the process, after the general plan and the ordering of the material have been decided on, and the buds of the tree are ready to burst open in their proper left-to-right order. In reality, however, one branch somewhere in the middle might blossom into words, while others have as yet hardly started to grow. And while it is true that the idea precedes the actual process of verbalisation, it is also true that ideas are often airy nothings until they crystallise into verbal concepts and acquire tangible shape....</p>

<p>Thus our tree progresses with irregular growth and constant oscillations between levels. Transforming thought into language is not a one-way process; the sap flows in both directions, up and down the branches of the tree. The operation is further complicated and sometimes brought to the verge of a breakdown by the author's deplorable tendency to correct, erase, chop off entire flowering branches from the tree and start growing them afresh".</p>

    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <p>My research interests revolve around making my data analyses easier and more reproducible. I'd like it if every step in the methodical exploration of (or prediction from) data is easily documented, reproduced, transformed, integrated and fun ... (if such a thing is possible).</p>

<p>I conceptualise data analyses as grouped networks of the many choices and revisions an analyst makes through a complex workflow in a project, clusters of which make up the many projects, databases and codebases analysts use everyday.</p>

<p>In my work as a data manager at a research school, I spend a lot of time linking together datasets to analyse population, health and environmental dimensions.  There are complex relationships to be found but because there are so many steps required for such an analysis workflow, and there are strong barriers to reproducibility.  A key barrier is due to the difficulties of tracking and documenting the numerous generations of derivative datasets and analyses.  I have developed an interest in software applications used during workflow actions and decision making to document a reproducible module of work; in desperately entwined and heroically integrated analyses.</p>

<h2>My Topics</h2>

<p>I am interested in systems analysis, especially of environmental health systems and</p>

<ul>
<li>interventions</li>
<li>catastrophes</li>
<li>explanations</li>
<li>predictions</li>
</ul>


<p>I also focus on</p>

<ul>
<li>Sucide and Drought in Southern Australia</li>
</ul>


<p>and Atmospherics, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>pollution events from Bushfires, dust storms, aeroallergen peaks</li>
<li>average exposures and extremes to temperature, humidity, rainfall... combinations of these</li>
</ul>


<p>I also dabble in other environmental health issues such as mosquito diseases and drinking water pathogens.</p>

<h2>My Tools</h2>

<p>I try do all my data integrations and analysis in R/Sweave.  I am currently planning to investigate the following tools</p>

<ul>
<li>R/Sweave/make</li>
<li>packages</li>
<li>python</li>
<li>version control (git)</li>
<li>graphviz</li>
<li>projectTemplate</li>
<li>workflow apps: kepler\taverna\RanalyticFlow\Rgraphviz</li>
<li>disentangleThings</li>
</ul>


<h2>My Intentions</h2>

<p>In this blog I will write about my experiences as I dealve into these new areas and write a PhD about them (and my research topics, knotted problems to be disentangled as we go). I am not a very adept programmer, but hopefully these tools will help enable me to deal with the intergrated analyses I hope to do.</p>
