<li>Gantt Charts are a method used in Project Management to visualise the task list and progress with a calendar.</li>
<li>The title of this post comes from <a href="http://berkeley.academia.edu/TomasAragon/Teaching/31679/Project_Management_for_Health_Professionals">Dr Tomas Aragon's paper 'Project Management for Health Professionals'</a></li>
<li>There is also an accompanying <a href="http://medepi.com/2012/02/05/project-mgmt/">Tutorial</a></li>
<li>Dr Aragon also has a couple of suggestions for software to use for creating Gantt Charts <a href="http://medepi.com/2011/11/29/software-recs/">on this page</a></li>
<li>I haven't used those but here are some I have used</li>
</ul>


<h4>Gantter</h4>

<ul>
<li>This is an online tool, that can integrate with Google Drive <a href="http://www.gantter.com/">http://www.gantter.com/</a></li>
<li>It also imports MS Project files</li>
</ul>


<h4>Taskjuggler</h4>

<ul>
<li>Emacs orgmode can be used with a Ruby package called Taskjuggler (tj3)</li>
<li>The command C-c C-e j will export a file such as this description ready for conversion <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler.html">http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler.html</a></li>
<li>I also needed to include this suggested by d.tchin 29 Feb 2012,  <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/52844">http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/52844</a></li>
<li>an example I use for a template is in my <a href="https://raw.github.com/ivanhanigan/disentangle/gh-pages/gantt-tj3/gantt-tj3.org">disentangle Github repo</a></li>
<li>which produces <a href="http://ivanhanigan.github.io/disentangle/gantt-tj3/Gantt%20Chart.html">this output</a></li>
</ul>

    </h1>
    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <ul>
<li>Last week I started a new discussion about sharing and extending research protocols.</li>
</ul>


<h4>My Colleague sent me a link to the <a href="http://prometheuswiki.publish.csiro.au/tiki-custom_home.php">Prometheus Wiki</a>​</h4>

<pre><code>a site for sharing research protocols. The idea is to give people
a place to post research protocols since everyone develops them
and then mentions them in papers but they rarely make it online in
a usable format. We see this as a big bottleneck in the rate of
knowledge discovery. Since users will always want to change and
adapt a given protocol for changing applications or new technology
or just to improve it. This sort of thing is done with open source
all the time (i.e. git) but how you'd do it with an online
protocol based out of a wiki is unknown. The current version of
the website is not very flexible and doesn't really enable the
sort of dynamic collaboration that I envision would make this a
really useful tool. Git seems like an obvious conceptual starting
point but there'd need to be a front end markup system in place
that was integrated with that git-type backend. Since you've
mentioned git a few times and the open science project, I thought
you might find this interesting to think about. any suggestions or
inspirations would be welcomed
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<h4>My past experience</h4>

<ul>
<li>I have previously tried to use a wiki for the development of new sections in an existing study protocol on estimating the effects of bushfire smoke air pollution and human health.</li>
<li>We combined elements of two major air pollution/health study protocols (one from Europe, one from America) with local considerations and decisions made within our team.</li>
<li>On reflection all this was mostly useful for me, to a lesser extent the other programmer and I don't think the project manager or statistician ever even looked at any of this.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Jeff Leek's current approach using GitHub</h4>

<p>I have been keeping an eye on the work by Jeff Leek on putting protocols onto Github and inviting collaboration to edit and extend them <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/07/the-leek-group-policy-for-developing-sustainable-r-packages/">as he says</a>:</p>

<pre><code>I put it on Github because I'm still not 100% sure I got it
right... I would welcome feedback/pull requests on how we can
improve the policy to make it better
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<h4>Leek Group policies and protocols on github so far</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages">https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages</a> accompanied by <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/07/the-leek-group-policy-for-developing-sustainable-r-packages/">this post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jtleek/reviews">https://github.com/jtleek/reviews</a> accompanied by <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/23/the-leek-group-guide-to-reviewing-scientific-papers/">this post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing">https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing</a> accompanied by <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/11/14/the-leek-group-guide-to-sharing-data-with-a-statistician-to-speed-collaboration/">this post</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>I forked "datasharing" for my own. Renamed: "How to share data to avoid misunderstanding"</h4>

<ul>
<li>I liked the datasharing policy so much <a href="http://ivanhanigan.github.io/datasharing/">I forked it for my own collaborations</a>.</li>
<li>I initially just made a minor recommendation to one of the lines in the original using the great Github feature that if you edit a repo you don't have access to, it forks the repo and creates a feature branch behind the scenes. After you submit the changes (which is a commit) it puts you right into the pull request form.</li>
<li>Therefore it can all be done on the GitHub site. I submitted <a href="https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing/pull/11">the pull request without leaving my web browser</a>.</li>
<li>But then I thought I would have done things a bit differently.  In particular I'd like a webpage with a table of contents, and a nicer looking landing page.</li>
<li>so I cloned my fork of the repo, then created a new branch called gh-pages, then copied the original to a new file called index.org, added some Emacs Orgmode HTML export magic and then "C-c C-e h" and WHAMM-O I've got my own version for extending with at <a href="http://ivanhanigan.github.io/datasharing/">http://ivanhanigan.github.io/datasharing/</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>The code version:</h4>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:ivanhanigan/datasharing.git ~/tools/datasharing
cd ~/tools/datasharing
git checkout -b gh-pages
mv README.md index.org
touch README.md
# edits to index.org, "C-c C-e h" and WHAMM-O
git add index.org index.html README.md
git push origin gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<ul>
<li>In this way I think people can share and collaborate easily <a href="http://yihui.name/en/2013/06/fix-typo-in-documentation/">(if they know git)</a></li>
<li>as well as easily take work started by someone else and extend it for their own work.</li>
<li>I wonder a little bit about how much of my extensions I should offer back to Jeff Leek as the original author.</li>
<li>I guess he can always track what I do to it via the link back to his original shown in <a href="https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing/network">https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing/network</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>PS Jeff Leek uses github a lot!</h4>

<p>As he says in <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/11/21/future-of-statistics-take-home-messages-futureofstats/">this post from the future-of-statistics unconference</a>:</p>

<pre><code>You can read it on Github here (https://github.com/jtleek/futureofstats).
I put it on Github for two reasons:

- I agree with Hadley's statement that the future of statistics is on Github.
- I summarized them based on my interpretation and would love
  collaboration on the document. If you want to add your new
  thoughts/summaries, add a new section with your bullet pointed
  ideas and send me a pull request!
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Jeff Leek is on to something really interesting with these github policies and protocols</li>
<li>I find the look of his plain markdown README.md pages a bit un-inspiring</li>
<li>but then I spend too much of my time tweaking my html by far (while Jeff is getting on with the real work of publishing papers)</li>
</ul>

    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <p>I asked my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/fahmiger">Marco Fahmi</a> to
post this as a guest post.  It came my way as a part of an email
exchange in which another colleague had a question regarding their task
of recording previous work in an ecological field study:</p>

<pre><code>ideally in such a way that we would end up with a complete metadata
profile of previous work carried out. I would also like to see the
establishment of a system that could also be used by the group going
forward to keep track of information and data produced at the
site. I hear you have been involved with establishing the
a metadata reporting system. How does this effort currently stand,
is it online? I was also wondering if you would be amenable to sharing
what you have with us with the hope that i could use this as a model
for our own system.
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<h4>Our colleague Sheila responded first that:</h4>

<p>All metadata are created using a standard template document and then transfered into a software package called <a href="http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp">Morpho</a>.  Metadata are then uploaded with the data to the Australian Supersite Network (ASN) Portal <a href="http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/knb/">http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/knb/</a>.   Any other useful documents are uploaded to the website <a href="http://www.tern-supersites.net.au">http://www.tern-supersites.net.au</a> either under the specific supersite tab on the left hand menu or under the Publications - Resources for SuperSite Users tab.</p>

<h4>Marco says:</h4>

<p>Morpho is an open source piece of software designed to host all kinds of ecological data. More information about how we use it at ASN can be found here: <a href="http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/index.php/data/repository-tutorial">http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/index.php/data/repository-tutorial</a></p>

<p>Morpho should be enough for an individual researcher to organise and describe their personal data collection. If you want to share the data with colleagues or publish them online, then you will also need Metacat. There is a worldwide Metacat server available from the link account. All you need to do is request an account and connect to it via Morpho. Alternatively you can set up your own; but then you will need your own server and tech knowhow to configure it (and maintain it).</p>

<p>For technical reasons, we have our own server running an older version of the Metacat software. You are welcome to use it if you wish (Shiela can issue you an account to log in and upload). We are also happy to provide assistance if you want to set something a standalone server for DRO. (Like any other piece of infrastructure, someone will need to look after the server after it is set up, so that's probably a decision that will need to be considered carefully).</p>

<h4>My comment:</h4>

<pre><code>"Morpho should be enough for an individual researcher to organise
and describe their personal data collection"
</code></pre>

<p>I agree, but would emphasise the <em>should</em> and then say <em>but</em> ...
Ultimately I'd like to see something as easy and intuitive as iTunes for music or Endnote and Mendeley for bibliographies, but...</p>

* Introduction
This is a sharp looking report template I got from an R blogger \cite{Bull2011}.

The pages after the first page have a nice looking header, footer and page number.
\clearpage

* Section 1
In the Org file you can see some hidden R code that computes a linear regression and returns the results shown in Table \ref{ATable}.
\input{ATable.tex}
\clearpage
