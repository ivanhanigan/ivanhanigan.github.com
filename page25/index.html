      <p>I am a huge fan of the R language for statistics and graphics.</p>

<p>I sometimes hear people say they don't like R but then admit that they have never tried to use it, or if they have it was close to ten years ago (and a lot has changed).</p>

<p>In recent discussions at work I got the impression some people have got a bit predjudiced against R and other software that they don't actually use, primarily because of the added difficulty of software that requires a bit of programming.</p>

<p>I think that multi-disciplinary work will inevitably mean we find a mix of software in use, and they'll all have strengths and weaknesses.  A major strength of R is that one can weave together a report that includes the data, code, graphs and interpretations for an analysis, rather than copy-and-pasting these elements together as is required with other software toolboxes.</p>

<p>For example a simple analysis in Rstudio using the 'R Markdown document' is below.</p>

<p>You can load and explore data in the document by placing 'Code Chunks' in the document, then when you click the <strong>Knit HTML</strong> button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:</p>

<pre><code>summary(cars)

    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <h2>The Ecological Fallacy</h2>

<p>The term 'Ecological fallacy' is used in Epidemiology and some other disciplines (such as Sociology) to refer to <a href="http://www.springer.com/medicine/book/978-1-4419-1004-2" title="Marc Gellman, J. Rick Turner. Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine Springer, 2012.">improperly inferring a causal association (or lack of association) at an individual-level based on a group-level relationship</a>. This use of the word ecological is at odds with the alternative use of the word in the discipline of Ecology.  <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-06919-9/toward-a-unified-ecology" title="Timothy F. H. Allen, Thomas W. Hoekstra. Toward a unified ecology. Columbia University Press, 1993.">Ecological methods from Ecology are inherently multi-scaled</a> and address precisely the issue of this cross-scale inferential fallacy.</p>

<p>I argue that a broader understanding of ecological methods by non-Ecologists would be a start towards better understanding between the disciplines.  The inclusion of real ecological methods in the other disciplines will also assist research to better understand the causes and effects of climate and climate change which are important gaps in knowledge needed to enable mitigation and adaptation of our society to future climate change.</p>

<h2>Sociology</h2>

<p>To clear up this confusion it is necessary to go back to the source of the use of the term 'ecological' by the urban sociologist Amos Hawley who used the term 'human ecology' in the 1950s to build on the theoretical traditions of <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=PCBWr5UySs8C&amp;dq=Meade%20and%20Earickson%202000%20medical%20geography&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions" title="Melinda S. Meade, Robert J. Earickson Medical Geography. Guilford Press 2005.">Robert Parke and E. W. Burgess at the University of Chicago in the 1920s on the structure and development of cities</a>. His influence in the Social Sciences led directly to the development a tradition of social human ecology, one largely without a bio-physical environment.  The usage of 'ecological' to mean multivariate studies of complex systems stems from the sociological tradition.</p>

<h2>Ecology</h2>

<p>The term 'ecology' used in the Ecology discipline <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology" title="Wikipedia">dates back to the 1870s</a>, coined by German zoologist Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) as Oekologie from Greek 'oikos' for house, dwelling place, habitation and 'logia' study of, then at the turn of the century the term became spelt 'oecology', which grew into 'ecology' in the early part of the 1900s.</p>

<h2>Epidemiology</h2>

<p>In epidemiology the term 'ecological study' is used to refer to studies where observations are taken at the level of a group (such as a country, school, or hospital) rather than at the individual <a href="http://www.springer.com/medicine/book/978-1-4419-1004-2" title="Marc Gellman, J. Rick Turner. Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine Springer, 2012.">(such as patient) level</a>.  It is well known though that when risk factors and outcomes are measured at an aggregate level, the relationship between the group-level variables may be different than the relationship between variables <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem" title="Openshaw, S. (1984). The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. Norwich: Geo Books. ISBN 0-86094-134-5.">measured at the individual level</a>. An often cited example used to illustrate the issue involved a 19th century study which found higher suicide rates within Prussian provinces that had <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=v23YleX1UskC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=durkheim&amp;ots=sXTEH3naVk&amp;sig=ycS5kkxwSUA_gA84ts3iXrYNStI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" title="Durkheim, E. (1951). Suicide: A study in sociology (Spaulding &amp; Simpson, trans.). Glencoe, IL: Free Press.(Original Work Published 1897).">higher proportions of Protestant residents</a>. The conclusion that Protestant individuals (rather than Catholic individuals) were more likely to commit suicide <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7137430" title="Morgenstern, H. (1982). Uses of ecologic analysis in epidemiologic research. American Journal of Public Health, 72(12)">cannot be inferred based on the observed association among the provinces</a>. One possible scenario is that Catholic residents within the largely Protestant provinces had the high suicide rates, resulting in a positive association between percent Protestant and suicide rate <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/05/24/ije.dyr081.full" title="Robinson, W.S. (1950). Ecological Correlations and the Behavior of Individuals. American Sociological Review (American Sociological Review, Vol. 15, No. 3) 15 (3): 351???357.">8</a>. Extrapolation of aggregate results to individuals is a mistake in logic <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/05/24/ije.dyr081.full" title="Robinson, W. S. (2009). Ecological correlations and the behavior of individuals. International Journal of Epidemiology, 38(2)">9</a> which can lead to a potentially misleading conclusion <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/05/24/ije.dyr081.full" title="Grotenhuis, Manfred, Rob Eisinga, and SV Subramanian. Robinson's Ecological Correlations and the Behavior of Individuals: methodological corrections. International journal of epidemiology 40, no. 4 2011: 1123-5.">10</a>.</p>

<p>Because of this limitation 'ecologic studies' are often scorned in epidemiology as inferior and only useful for exploratory or hypothesis-generating studies rather than as confirmatory.  I argue to the contrary that there is the potential for a revolution in our ability to understand causal influences operating at multiple scales of space and time if we were to conduct truly 'ecological studies'.</p>

<h2>Quantitative Geography</h2>

<p>There is also a closely related concept that should be noted.  That of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem" title="Openshaw, S. (1984). The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. Norwich: Geo Books. ISBN 0-86094-134-5.">(MAUP)</a> as discussed in quantitative geography.  There is a large amount of geographical literature on the MAUP.  In this problem domain areal units (also called zones, regions, areas or polygons) inherently pose three problems to a researcher attempting to infer causal associations: scale, zonal and temporal:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scale; this issues is evident in the example above where phenomena investigated using data viewed at one scale may appear quite different (even opposite) using data aggregated at a different scale.</li>
<li>Zonal; the zonal problem appears where phenomena investigated using data viewed using two sets of differing areas at a single scale can differ.</li>
<li>Temporal; a third problem arises when analyzing data on modifiable areas when people keep modifying them by redrawing the boundaries over time.</li>
</ul>


<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>The term 'Ecological Fallacy' is itself a fallacy and non-Ecologists should be made aware of the existence of alternative ecologic methods from Ecology.  This would be a start towards better understanding between the disciplines and enhance our abilities to mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p>

    </h1>
    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <h2>Droughts are extreme rainfall events on centennial scale</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/ivanhanigan/HutchinsonDroughtIndex" title="Hutchinson Drought Index project">Hutchinson Drought Index project</a> we used the longest period of rainfall data available because the drought index is based on the ranking of each six-month average of the distribution in the entire record of observations. A period as long as this is required to calculate extreme rainfall deficits.  The original Hutchinson paper used a period 1920-1988 due to availability.  Another consideration is the longer term characteristics of the rainfall epoch you are considering.</p>

<p>For example, in recent decades in Southeastern Australia annual total rainfal does not represent the longer term context very well.  Shown in the image below is the result of an exploratory data analysis using rainfall data from the Murray Darling Basin (the 'bread basket' of Australian agriculture).  I use the Classification And Regression Tree tool in the 'rpart' package to determine the optimal groupings.  I've dropped the last two years of the sequence because when I first ran this analysis two years ago I got the result shown, but thankfully the last two years have given us very good rainfalls.  This shows the difference between short-term and long-term rainfall patterns.</p>

<p>Regardless of this data 'massaging', in the analysis presented the annual trend over the first half of the twentieth century was lower than the recent fifty years, by about 60 millimeters on average. The 1930-1946 period was particularly dry, as has been the 1998-2008 period.</p>

      <h2>I'm having trouble explaining my current research interests.</h2>

<p>I'm currently working on suicide and drought, heart disease and woodsmoke, violent deaths and heatwaves and a theoretical text on methods for rates, standardisation or adjustment in regression models.</p>

<p>Why? It's complicated, but...</p>

<p>I have been working on a range of interrelated projects for the last few years that have revolved around the influence of climate on human health and wellbeing.<br/>
That might sound clear enough on first glance, but when we got stuck in to it we found we struggled to find very many health outcomes with really potent causal influences of climatic variables from the literature.</p>

<h2>HUMAN HEALTH AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN OCEANIA: A RISK ASSESSMENT 2002 </h2>

<p>This all started with my involvement with the report <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.gov.au%2Finternet%2Fmain%2Fpublishing.nsf%2Fcontent%2F2D4037B384BC05F6CA256F1900042840%2F%24File%2Fenv_climate.pdf&amp;ei=OhOhT8jeIuiviQfy6fHgBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNH123UycdMu__7_cnN3BcqBu7_YYg&amp;sig2=PUesyxJP74acSneaziy5PA" title="DHA CC HIA 2002">1</a> by Tony McMichael and Rosalie Woodruff.  I was a research assistant and got my first taste of integrating data across population, health and environmental domains.</p>

<p>We did a great job, but after we'd completed that work, Colin and I reflected on how difficult it was to find those 'low haning fruit' that might be most easily analysted in this new direction of environmental epidemioligy.  We then met Neville Nicholls from the BoM and found out that there was a strong suspicion of the increased risk of suicide during droughts amongst the meteorologists (to the point they were anxious about reporting unfavourable forecasting seasonal rainfall estimates based on the SOI and El Nino weather patterns).  We ended up publishing a simple paper about that topic <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/research/interannual-rainfall-variations-suicide-new-south-wales-australia-1964/" title="Nicholls et al 2005">2</a></p>

<p>Other health outcomes suggested themselves over the course of the following few years:</p>

<ul>
<li>will be bullet points</li>
<li>includes Ross River Virus in WA</li>
<li>heart disease and woodsmoke</li>
<li>violent deaths and heatwaves</li>
<li>a theoretical text on methods for rates, standardisation or adjustment in regression models</li>
</ul>


<p>So I am struggling to get a succint statement that reflects the current focus of my research interests.
Luckily my core reasearch interest is simpler: better understanding the dynamics of the many systems involved in human ecology.</p>

      <h2>Dengue Fever (DF) and climate</h2>

<p>DF is a mosquito borne virus that has high public health impact and is potentially strongly influenced by climate.</p>

<p>There is an interesting story attached to this map from a paper by Russell et al 2009 <a href="http://www.google.com" title="Russell, Richard C, Bart J Currie, Michael D Lindsay, John S Mackenzie, Scott A Ritchie, and Peter I Whelan. Dengue and climate change in Australia: predictions for the future should incorporate knowledge from the past. Medical Journal of Australia 190, no. 5 (2009)">1</a> that draws together documentary references to historic Dengue Fever (DF) transmission, some as far south as Gosford and Bourke in NSW.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Russell2009MJA.jpg" alt="Russel map of Dengue Virus" /></p>

<p>This asserted southerly extent is much further south than that delineated in the Potential Climatic Niche model of Hales et al 2002 <a href="http://www.google.com" title="Hales, S., N. de Wet, J. Maindonald, and A. Woodward. Potential effect of population and climate changes on global distribution of dengue fever: an empirical model. The Lancet 360, no. 9336 (2002)">2</a> and is used as a basis to refute the veracity (and utility) of such a model.</p>

<p>The Hales' model determined the potential transmission zone in Australia as being constrained much further north by levels of humidity (vapour pressure).  That predictive model was based on a regression of many climatic attributes of all locations of disease transmission in a global database.  There is an ongoing debate between the epidemiology and the entomology camps over this modelling.</p>

<p>A key issue regarding this contentious map is a reference used by Russell et al <a href="http://www.google.com" title="Russell, Richard C, Bart J Currie, Michael D Lindsay, John S Mackenzie, Scott A Ritchie, and Peter I Whelan. Dengue and climate change in Australia: predictions for the future should incorporate knowledge from the past. Medical Journal of Australia 190, no. 5 (2009)">1</a> to dengue transmission having occurred inland at Bourke (30 S) and on the coast at Gosford  (33 S, 80 km north of Sydney) in the first half of the 1900s, (ref 13 Lee et al, 1987 &amp; ref 14 Lumley and Taylor 1943 ).  However, a text search of Lee et al revealed only one reference to Gosford  and that refers to the presence of vector mosquito Aedes aegypti (AE), but not dengue transmission.</p>

<p>The second reference is by the entomologist Frank H Taylor who mentions Brooklyn NSW, on page 158 (paragraph 2) .. as "the most southerly discovered location of AE" (the vector of DF in this area). Now, Brooklyn is on the railway on the Hawkesbury just south of Gosford. Taylor talks about railways spreading the vector. Maybe AE was found in NSW in conjunction with steam trains and railway water tanks for steam trains (the railway to Bourke was opened in 1885).  There is no clear discussion in Lumley and Taylor of DF transmission around Brooklyn.</p>

<p>It is possible that the references cited for this map are really just evidence of the vector distribution, not actual virus transmission.  It is also likely that the southern-most border of the AE vector would not be the southern-most fringe of DF transmission. This therefore casts doubt on Russell's map which suggests the southern limit of DF transmission to have been as far south as Gosford and Bourke in NSW (Bourke is also asserted by Russell et al as a known transmission site using these same references).</p>

<p>What Russell may be doing is just connecting the two points - Brooklyn and Bourke (who knows if there is a single data point in between) and asserting that that line of southernmost AE proof is the southerly boundary of DF transmission.  Perhaps if AE got to Brooklyn it might also have got to Bourke .. and Bourke being hotter than Brooklyn, DF transmission may have occurred there .. but we need more evidence than Russell et al provide.</p>

<p>(Thanks to my epidemiological friends for scouring the historical references with a thoroughly incredulous eye).</p>
