<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>I recently attended a class on spatial regression with Prof Bob
Haining.  He described the issue of spatially correlated errors and
the problems this poses in spatial regression.
</p>
<p>
The key issue is that spatial data often violates the assumption in
regression models that the errors are independent. 
</p>
<p>
A simple regression model applied to spatial data based on ZONES:
</p>


\(Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + ZONE_{i} + \beta_{1} X_{1i} + e_{i}\)

<p>
But with spatial data it is likely that the errors are spatially
correlated.  This is likely to mean the point estimate of beta 1 is OK
but the Standard Error is wrong.
</p>
<p>
This might be due to the scale of the study units, which may not
capture the variation of exposure and outcome adequately. Or there
might be unmeasured explanatory variables that have not been accounted
for.
</p>
<p>
I am mostly concerned with EXPLANATORY modelling in which a particular
exposure of interest is to be assessed.  Examples include a weather
variable (temperature), an air pollutant (PM10) or some measure of
socio-economic deprivation in an area (SEIFA scores in Australian
census data).  In these models I tend to include a number of
'nuisance' parameters to control for confounding; or interaction terms
to account for effect modification.  In this type of model the
performance of the model over-all is not that important, I just want
to control for the most important confounders so that my estimate of
the exposure of interest is as rigorous as possible.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the problem that spatially correlated errors pose for these models is
slightly different to that which affects models aimed at PREDICTION: I
am not concerned so much with the model's fit to the data, rather the
confidence around the point-estimate of the parameter for the exposure
of interest.
</p>
<p>
Simplistically I took away the following messages:
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> The Spatial Error Model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>So we could model allowing for correlated errors:
</p>


\(Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + ZONE_{i} + \beta_{1} X_{1i} + \eta_{i}\)

<p>
Where:
</p>
<p>
\(\eta_{i}\) = Spatially autocorrelated errors.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> The Spatial Lag Model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>Or we could include a term for the neighbours, thus absorbing the correlated errors:
</p>


\(Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + ZONE_{i} + \beta_{1} X_{1i} + \rho(Neighbours Y_{ij}) + e_{i}\)

<p>
Where:
</p>
<p>
\(\rho_(Neighbours Y_{ij})\) = is an additional explanatory variable which is the value of the dependent variable in neighbouring areas. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Spatially Lagged Independent Variable(s)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>This is almost a variation of the spatial lag model, except that we
include a term for the exposure variable in the neighbours, and
therefore 'smooth' the effect of the exposure from what was observed
in any area to make it relevant to it's neighbours as well:
</p>


\(Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + ZONE_{i} + \beta_{1} X_{1i} + \beta_{2L} X_{2ij} + e_{i}\)

<p>
Where:
</p>
<p>
\(\beta_{2L} X_{2ij}\) = is the independent variable X2 that is spatially lagged.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Discussion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


</div>

<div id="outline-container-5-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-1"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> How to decide which model to fit?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">

<p>So the burning question is how to choose between the various spatial
models? Prof Haining had some suggestions, but he noted that sometimes
two could be equally appropriate.  He suggested that the spatial lag
model makes the strong assumption that there is a relationship between
the outcome in a neighbouring area with the index zone.  This suggests
some kind of contagion or dispersion effect.  He was not keen to fit
this model in circumstances where the causal mechanism did not support
such a relationship, suggesting the spatially weighted error model was
more suited, but that "in practice they often give the same result".
</p>
<p>
In my situation where I am not concerned with the actual
autocorrelation but with tightening up the standard error on my
exposure of interest, I think I might plead forgiveness and try
fitting the spatial lag model as it seems easier.

      <p>I am a huge fan of the R language for statistics and graphics.</p>

<p>I sometimes hear people say they don't like R but then admit that they have never tried to use it, or if they have it was close to ten years ago (and a lot has changed).</p>

<p>In recent discussions at work I got the impression some people have got a bit predjudiced against R and other software that they don't actually use, primarily because of the added difficulty of software that requires a bit of programming.</p>

<p>I think that multi-disciplinary work will inevitably mean we find a mix of software in use, and they'll all have strengths and weaknesses.  A major strength of R is that one can weave together a report that includes the data, code, graphs and interpretations for an analysis, rather than copy-and-pasting these elements together as is required with other software toolboxes.</p>

<p>For example a simple analysis in Rstudio using the 'R Markdown document' is below.</p>

<p>You can load and explore data in the document by placing 'Code Chunks' in the document, then when you click the <strong>Knit HTML</strong> button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:</p>

    </h1>
    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <h2>The Ecological Fallacy</h2>

<p>The term 'Ecological fallacy' is used in Epidemiology and some other disciplines (such as Sociology) to refer to <a href="http://www.springer.com/medicine/book/978-1-4419-1004-2" title="Marc Gellman, J. Rick Turner. Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine Springer, 2012.">improperly inferring a causal association (or lack of association) at an individual-level based on a group-level relationship</a>. This use of the word ecological is at odds with the alternative use of the word in the discipline of Ecology.  <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-06919-9/toward-a-unified-ecology" title="Timothy F. H. Allen, Thomas W. Hoekstra. Toward a unified ecology. Columbia University Press, 1993.">Ecological methods from Ecology are inherently multi-scaled</a> and address precisely the issue of this cross-scale inferential fallacy.</p>

<p>I argue that a broader understanding of ecological methods by non-Ecologists would be a start towards better understanding between the disciplines.  The inclusion of real ecological methods in the other disciplines will also assist research to better understand the causes and effects of climate and climate change which are important gaps in knowledge needed to enable mitigation and adaptation of our society to future climate change.</p>

<h2>Sociology</h2>

<p>To clear up this confusion it is necessary to go back to the source of the use of the term 'ecological' by the urban sociologist Amos Hawley who used the term 'human ecology' in the 1950s to build on the theoretical traditions of <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=PCBWr5UySs8C&amp;dq=Meade%20and%20Earickson%202000%20medical%20geography&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions" title="Melinda S. Meade, Robert J. Earickson Medical Geography. Guilford Press 2005.">Robert Parke and E. W. Burgess at the University of Chicago in the 1920s on the structure and development of cities</a>. His influence in the Social Sciences led directly to the development a tradition of social human ecology, one largely without a bio-physical environment.  The usage of 'ecological' to mean multivariate studies of complex systems stems from the sociological tradition.</p>

<h2>Ecology</h2>

<p>The term 'ecology' used in the Ecology discipline <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology" title="Wikipedia">dates back to the 1870s</a>, coined by German zoologist Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) as Oekologie from Greek 'oikos' for house, dwelling place, habitation and 'logia' study of, then at the turn of the century the term became spelt 'oecology', which grew into 'ecology' in the early part of the 1900s.</p>

<h2>Epidemiology</h2>

<p>In epidemiology the term 'ecological study' is used to refer to studies where observations are taken at the level of a group (such as a country, school, or hospital) rather than at the individual <a href="http://www.springer.com/medicine/book/978-1-4419-1004-2" title="Marc Gellman, J. Rick Turner. Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine Springer, 2012.">(such as patient) level</a>.  It is well known though that when risk factors and outcomes are measured at an aggregate level, the relationship between the group-level variables may be different than the relationship between variables <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem" title="Openshaw, S. (1984). The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. Norwich: Geo Books. ISBN 0-86094-134-5.">measured at the individual level</a>. An often cited example used to illustrate the issue involved a 19th century study which found higher suicide rates within Prussian provinces that had <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=v23YleX1UskC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=durkheim&amp;ots=sXTEH3naVk&amp;sig=ycS5kkxwSUA_gA84ts3iXrYNStI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" title="Durkheim, E. (1951). Suicide: A study in sociology (Spaulding &amp; Simpson, trans.). Glencoe, IL: Free Press.(Original Work Published 1897).">higher proportions of Protestant residents</a>. The conclusion that Protestant individuals (rather than Catholic individuals) were more likely to commit suicide <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7137430" title="Morgenstern, H. (1982). Uses of ecologic analysis in epidemiologic research. American Journal of Public Health, 72(12)">cannot be inferred based on the observed association among the provinces</a>. One possible scenario is that Catholic residents within the largely Protestant provinces had the high suicide rates, resulting in a positive association between percent Protestant and suicide rate <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/05/24/ije.dyr081.full" title="Robinson, W.S. (1950). Ecological Correlations and the Behavior of Individuals. American Sociological Review (American Sociological Review, Vol. 15, No. 3) 15 (3): 351???357.">8</a>. Extrapolation of aggregate results to individuals is a mistake in logic <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/05/24/ije.dyr081.full" title="Robinson, W. S. (2009). Ecological correlations and the behavior of individuals. International Journal of Epidemiology, 38(2)">9</a> which can lead to a potentially misleading conclusion <a href="http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/05/24/ije.dyr081.full" title="Grotenhuis, Manfred, Rob Eisinga, and SV Subramanian. Robinson's Ecological Correlations and the Behavior of Individuals: methodological corrections. International journal of epidemiology 40, no. 4 2011: 1123-5.">10</a>.</p>

<p>Because of this limitation 'ecologic studies' are often scorned in epidemiology as inferior and only useful for exploratory or hypothesis-generating studies rather than as confirmatory.  I argue to the contrary that there is the potential for a revolution in our ability to understand causal influences operating at multiple scales of space and time if we were to conduct truly 'ecological studies'.</p>

<h2>Quantitative Geography</h2>

<p>There is also a closely related concept that should be noted.  That of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem" title="Openshaw, S. (1984). The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem. Norwich: Geo Books. ISBN 0-86094-134-5.">(MAUP)</a> as discussed in quantitative geography.  There is a large amount of geographical literature on the MAUP.  In this problem domain areal units (also called zones, regions, areas or polygons) inherently pose three problems to a researcher attempting to infer causal associations: scale, zonal and temporal:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scale; this issues is evident in the example above where phenomena investigated using data viewed at one scale may appear quite different (even opposite) using data aggregated at a different scale.</li>
<li>Zonal; the zonal problem appears where phenomena investigated using data viewed using two sets of differing areas at a single scale can differ.</li>
<li>Temporal; a third problem arises when analyzing data on modifiable areas when people keep modifying them by redrawing the boundaries over time.</li>
</ul>


<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>The term 'Ecological Fallacy' is itself a fallacy and non-Ecologists should be made aware of the existence of alternative ecologic methods from Ecology.  This would be a start towards better understanding between the disciplines and enhance our abilities to mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/ivanhanigan/HutchinsonDroughtIndex" title="Hutchinson Drought Index project">Hutchinson Drought Index project</a> we used the longest period of rainfall data available because the drought index is based on the ranking of each six-month average of the distribution in the entire record of observations. A period as long as this is required to calculate extreme rainfall deficits.  The original Hutchinson paper used a period 1920-1988 due to availability.  Another consideration is the longer term characteristics of the rainfall epoch you are considering.</p>

<p>For example, in recent decades in Southeastern Australia annual total rainfal does not represent the longer term context very well.  Shown in the image below is the result of an exploratory data analysis using rainfall data from the Murray Darling Basin (the 'bread basket' of Australian agriculture).  I use the Classification And Regression Tree tool in the 'rpart' package to determine the optimal groupings.  I've dropped the last two years of the sequence because when I first ran this analysis two years ago I got the result shown, but thankfully the last two years have given us very good rainfalls.  This shows the difference between short-term and long-term rainfall patterns.</p>

<p>Regardless of this data 'massaging', in the analysis presented the annual trend over the first half of the twentieth century was lower than the recent fifty years, by about 60 millimeters on average. The 1930-1946 period was particularly dry, as has been the 1998-2008 period.</p>

      <h2>I'm having trouble explaining my current research interests.</h2>

<p>I'm currently working on suicide and drought, heart disease and woodsmoke, violent deaths and heatwaves and a theoretical text on methods for rates, standardisation or adjustment in regression models.</p>

<p>Why? It's complicated, but...</p>

<p>I have been working on a range of interrelated projects for the last few years that have revolved around the influence of climate on human health and wellbeing.<br/>
That might sound clear enough on first glance, but when we got stuck in to it we found we struggled to find very many health outcomes with really potent causal influences of climatic variables from the literature.</p>

<h2>HUMAN HEALTH AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN OCEANIA: A RISK ASSESSMENT 2002 </h2>

<p>This all started with my involvement with the report <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.gov.au%2Finternet%2Fmain%2Fpublishing.nsf%2Fcontent%2F2D4037B384BC05F6CA256F1900042840%2F%24File%2Fenv_climate.pdf&amp;ei=OhOhT8jeIuiviQfy6fHgBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNH123UycdMu__7_cnN3BcqBu7_YYg&amp;sig2=PUesyxJP74acSneaziy5PA" title="DHA CC HIA 2002">1</a> by Tony McMichael and Rosalie Woodruff.  I was a research assistant and got my first taste of integrating data across population, health and environmental domains.</p>

<p>We did a great job, but after we'd completed that work, Colin and I reflected on how difficult it was to find those 'low haning fruit' that might be most easily analysted in this new direction of environmental epidemioligy.  We then met Neville Nicholls from the BoM and found out that there was a strong suspicion of the increased risk of suicide during droughts amongst the meteorologists (to the point they were anxious about reporting unfavourable forecasting seasonal rainfall estimates based on the SOI and El Nino weather patterns).  We ended up publishing a simple paper about that topic <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/research/interannual-rainfall-variations-suicide-new-south-wales-australia-1964/" title="Nicholls et al 2005">2</a></p>

<p>Other health outcomes suggested themselves over the course of the following few years:</p>

<ul>
<li>will be bullet points</li>
<li>includes Ross River Virus in WA</li>
<li>heart disease and woodsmoke</li>
<li>violent deaths and heatwaves</li>
<li>a theoretical text on methods for rates, standardisation or adjustment in regression models</li>
</ul>


<p>So I am struggling to get a succint statement that reflects the current focus of my research interests.
Luckily my core reasearch interest is simpler: better understanding the dynamics of the many systems involved in human ecology.</p>
