      <p>I just read this impressive paper and it has really given me a push toward making this open lab notebook</p>

<h4>Quote</h4>

<pre><code>The situation is a classic collective action problem. Many individual researchers lack
strong incentives to be more transparent, even though the credibility of science would 
benefit if everyone were more transparent.
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>So I think I'll try to step up the pace of logging my daily scientific work.
One super easy thing to do is to publish my daily log from my task management in orgmode.
Indeed I am also reading at the moment this guy who says</p>

<h4>Quote</h4>

<pre><code>The core of your documentation is the research log.

</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>Finally, I was struck by this reference <a href="http://rich-iannone.github.io/about/2014/10/28/introduction.html">http://rich-iannone.github.io/about/2014/10/28/introduction.html</a> to something about 365+ day GitHub streaks. It was covered earlier by Geoff Greer, and by Dirk Eddelbuettel.</p>

<p>It seems the basic concept is that you can leverage off an obsessive tendency by making sure you do something toward ticking off items from the task list every day.  The impulse to not breaking the chain is supposed to give you inspiration to keep going.  I think this might work well for my temperatment.</p>

<h2>Emacs and orgmode</h2>

<p>The set up of my daily log is pretty simple. After being set up by kjhealy's starter kit.
Then I modified the org-agenda-files which was set in the main el file that kjhealy provided  and then with the command C-c a a emacs will display my calendar.</p>

<p>When I open emacs in the morning I  open the agenda and this also opens research-log file.  I move to that buffer, then I use this key command to insert a new entry for todays date</p>

<h4>CODE</h4>

<pre><code> (define-skeleton org-journalentry
   "Template for a journal entry."
   "project:"
   "*** " (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %a") " \n"
   "**** TODO-list \n"
   "***** TODO \n"
   "**** timesheet\n"
   "#+begin_src txt :tangle work-log.csv :eval no :padline no\n"
   (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %a") ", " str ", 50\n" 
   "#+end_src\n"
 )
 (global-set-key [C-S-f5] 'org-journalentry)
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>This creates a new date, a stub of a TODO for anything ad hoc and a entry into my timesheet.csv file.</p>

<p>I then select from TODO items from a global list that I keep at the top of the file, and cut/paste them into todays list.</p>

<p><img src="/images/agenda.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Great so I just moved this research-log orgmode file into my blog github repo, and with the help of charlie park's bash script I am good to go</p>

<h4>CODE</h4>

<pre><code>alias build_blog="cd ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com.raw; jekyll b;
cp -r ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com.raw/_site/* ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com;
cd ~/projects/ivanhanigan.github.com;git add .;git commit -am 'Latest build.';git push"
alias bb="build_blog"
</code></pre>

<p></p>


<p>So this will put the resulting changes onto my open lab book website here <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanhanigan/ivanhanigan.github.com/master/work-log.org">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanhanigan/ivanhanigan.github.com/master/work-log.org</a></p>

<p>Things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>I found this list of tips <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/streak-github-mistakes/">http://natashatherobot.com/streak-github-mistakes/</a></li>
<li>In particular I realise I need to make my daily push by 4:50 PM in Canberra ACT as this is 11:50 PM the previous day for Github, Pacific Time (PT)</li>
<li>I also will need to ensure I don't publish sensitive (or embarrasing entries).</li>
<li>I'll try to keep the identity of my collaborators private as well, so just use their initials rather than names.</li>
</ul>

<p>The caps question is from someone reading my draft.  I need to start with the why.
Perhaps just turn the paragraph on its head?</p>

    <div class="entry-content full-content">
      <p>I have just uploaded a new version of the windows build for my 'disentangle' package.  The blurb of the  draft vignette is below.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>It can be much easier to conceptually understand a complicated data
analysis pipeline than it is to implement that pipeline effectively.
This report outlines the use of the 'disentangle' R package, available from <a href="http://ivanhanigan.github.io/projects.html">http://ivanhanigan.github.io/projects.html</a>.  This package contains functions that were developed to aid data
analysts to map out all the aspects of their work when planning and
conducting complicated data analyses using the pipeline concept.    There are often many steps in the design and analysis of a study and
when these are put together as a data analysis pipeline this addresses
the challenge of reproducibility (Peng 2006).  The
credibility of data analyses requires that every step is able to be
scrutinised (Leek 2015).</p>

<h2>Motivating scientific questions</h2>

<p>The type of data analysis that is
the focus of this work is more complicated than simply loading some
data that are already cleaned, fitting some models and reporting some
output.  Typically the type of data analysis projects that these tools
are aimed at involve attempts to control for a large number
of inter-relationships and associations between variables. It is
especially problematic that these variables need to have been selected
by the scientists from a multitude of possible variables and a
plethora of possible data sources, during a long process of data
collection, cleaning, exploration and decision making in preparation
for data analysis. There are also a multitude of steps and decision
points in the process of model building and model checking. The use of
statistical models involving many entangled environmental and social
variables can easily result in spurious association that may be
mistakenly interpreted as causation.  Projects that the author has
been involved in include explorations of hypotheses about health effects from
droughts, bushfire smoke, heat-waves and dust-storms which produced
novel findings, and informed controversial debates about the
implications of climate change. The requirement to adequately convey
the methods and results of this research was problematic and motivated
the work on effective use of reproducible research techniques and data
analysis pipelines.</p>

      <h1>Update</h1>

<ul>
<li>This is an update to my previous post:  <a href="http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2014/12/climate-grids-and-thredds-server-experimenting/">http://ivanhanigan.github.io/2014/12/climate-grids-and-thredds-server-experimenting/</a></li>
<li>I was worried about the available metadata with those netcdf data I was working with so contacted Dr Brad Evans at EMAST who set me straight:</li>
</ul>


<h4>QUOTE:</h4>

<pre><code>"you need to use ncdf4  - not ncdf  ...
because they are netcdf4 files and not netcdf3 files. 
This is poorly explained in the R community.
All of the netcdf files from Australian providers (AusCover, BoM, etc...) 
have been in netcdf4 for a couple of years now."
</code></pre>

<h1>So here is the revised code using ncdf4 library:</h1>

<h4>CODE</h4>

<pre><code># sudo apt-get install r-cran-ncdf4 
library(ncdf4)
library(raster)

dates &lt;- seq(as.Date(strt),as.Date(end),1)

Daily temperature regulates rates of plant growth and determines critical conditions such as frost on flowering and fruiting. Modelled by expressing each daily value as a difference anomaly with respect to the gridded 1976-2005 mean daily minimum temperature for each month as provided by eMAST_ANUClimate_mmn_tmin_v1m0_1976_2005. The daily anomalies were interpolated by trivariate thin plate smoothing spline functions of longitude, latitude and vertically exaggerated elevation using ANUSPLIN Version 4.5. There was an average of 671 Bureau of Meteorology data points available for each day between 1970 and 2012. Automated quality assessment rejected on average 3 data values per day with extreme studentised residuals. These were commonly associated with days following missing observations. The root mean square of all individual cross validation residuals provided by the spline analysis is 1.5 degrees Celsius. A comprehensive assessment of the analysis and the factors contributing to the quality of the final interpolated daily minimum temperature grids is in preparation."

      <h1>Introduction</h1>

<ul>
<li>Over the last few months I have used software called Metacat as a Data Portal and Repository.  Metacat is server software which has been
developed by the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB).</li>
<li>Metacat
conforms to the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) Standard (<a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/index.html">https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/index.html</a>).</li>
<li>KNB also develop another software package called Morpho to be used by Ecologists to document their data (<a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools">https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools/morpho</a>).</li>
<li>Morpho can be used to send the data and metadata documents to be published on a Metacat portal.</li>
<li>KNB’s software is used internationally by the Data
Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) nodes, the United States Long
Term Ecological Research (US LTER) network and the International Long
Term Ecological Research (ILTER) network.</li>
<li>Additionally, the Australian Long Term Ecological Research Network
Data Portal (<a href="http://www.ltern.org.au/knb/">www.ltern.org.au/knb/</a>), Australian SuperSites Network and
Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis used
the same underlying technology to publish data packages.</li>
<li>The Metacat system is great for a data repository but unfortunately (in my experience) the Morpho software package has repeatedly hampered data processing and increased risks of inadvertently publishing data with errors.</li>
<li>My colleagues and I workaround these problems using a lot of different 'fixes' for the different problems.</li>
<li>Fortunately there is an alternative to Morpho in the R statistical software environment called the R-EML package (<a href="https://github.com/ropensci/EML">https://github.com/ropensci/EML</a>).  This provides a library of functions used in the R language to generate and parse EML files.</li>
<li>This new workflow mitigates some of the risks of the Morpho software by ensuring the data related steps of the workflow are conducted in the R environment for statical computing.</li>
<li>However, some Issues remain in that this requires a fairly specialised computing environment with various Linux libraries configured appropriately</li>
</ul>


<h1>Results</h1>

<ul>
<li>I generate EML metadata using REML in the workflow shown in the figure below.</li>
