## Current Research

### What is the influence of agriculture on spatially variable selection on floral traits in Helianthus (sunflower)?

Very little work has been done to incorporate the influence of crops into selection on floral traits. This is despite the fact that most species probably occur in close proximity to human disturbance of some kind, whether development, pollution, habitat fragmentation, or agriculture. I am using wild and cultivated Helianthus annuus to explore how agriculture influences selection on floral traits via biotic pathways of mutualists vs antagonists.
