  abstract = {Issues related to data preservation and sharing are receiving increased attention from scientific societies, funding agencies, and the broad scientific community. Ecologists, for example, are increasingly using data collected by other scientists to address questions at broader spatial, temporal, and thematic scales (e.g., global change, biodiversity, sustainability). No data set is perfect and self-explanatory. Ecologists must, therefore, rely upon a set of instructions or documentation to acquire a specific data set, determine its suitability for meeting specific research objectives, and accurately interpret results from subsequent processing, analysis, and modeling. {"}Metadata{"} represent the set of instructions or documentation that describe the content, context, quality, structure, and accessibility of a data set. Although geospatial metadata standards have been developed and widely endorsed by the geographical science community, such standards do not yet exist for the ecological sciences. In this paper, we examine potential benefits and costs associated with developing and implementing metadata for nongeospatial ecological data. We present a set of generic metadata descriptors that could serve as the basis for a {"}metadata standard{"} for nongeospatial ecological data. Alternative strategies for metadata implementation that meet differing organizational or investigator-specific objectives are presented. Finally, we conclude with several recommendations related to future development and implementation of ecological metadata.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Helminth (worm) infections cause morbidity among poor communities worldwide. An influential study conducted in Kenya in 1998-99 reported that a school-based drug-and-educational intervention had benefits for worm infections and school attendance. Methods: In this statistical replication, we re-analysed data from this cluster quasi- randomized stepped-wedge trial, specifying two co-primary outcomes: school attendance and examination performance. We estimated intention-to-treat effects using year-stratified cluster-summary analysis and observation-level random-effects regression, and combined both years with a random-effects model accounting for year. The participants were not blinded to allocation status, and other interventions were concurrently conducted in a sub-set of schools. A protocol guiding outcome data collection was not available. Results: Quasi-randomization resulted in three similar groups of 25 schools. There was a substantial amount of missing data. In year-stratified cluster-summary analysis, there was no clear evidence for improvement in either school attendance or examination performance. In year-stratified regression models, there was some evidence of improvement in school attendance [adjusted odds ratios (aOR): year 1: 1.48, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-2.52, P = 0.150; year 2: 1.23, 95\% CI 1.01-1.51, P = 0.044], but not examination performance (adjusted differences: year 1: -0.135, 95\% CI -0.323-0.054, P = 0.161; year 2: -0.017, 95\% CI -0.201-0.166, P = 0.854). When both years were combined, there was strong evidence of an effect on attendance (aOR 1.82, 95\% CI 1.74-1.91, P < 0.001), but not examination performance (adjusted difference -0.121, 95\% CI -0.293-0.052, P = 0.169). Conclusions: The evidence supporting an improvement in school attendance differed by analysis method. This, and various other important limitations of the data, caution against over-interpretation of the results. We find that the study provides some evidence, but with high risk of bias, that a school-based drug-treatment and health-education intervention improved school attendance and no evidence of effect on examination performance.},

@Article{Bodnar2004,
  abstract = {Few books about the environment have generated as much heated debate as Bj\o rn Lomborg's 'The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World', published by Cambridge University Press in 2001. A flavor of the controversy can be gleaned from a series of reviews and rebuttals published in 'Scientific American' (Rennie 2002). In general, most positive reviews appeared in the popular press (e.g., 'The Economist', 'Washington Post Book Review', 'The Wall Street Journal') and most negative reviews appeared in the scientific press (e.g., 'Science', 'Nature', 'Bioscience'). Although 'The Skeptical Environmentalist' (TSE) addresses a number of environmental health issues, voices from the environmental health community have not been prominent among the participants in this debate. Now that the dust from the initial stampede to praise and condemn the book has settled, we will explore lessons to be learned from TSE and the associated debate from an environmental health perspective.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helminth (worm) infections cause morbidity among poor communities worldwide. An influential study conducted in Kenya in 1998-99 reported that a school-based drug-and-educational intervention had benefits regarding worm infections and school attendance. Effects were seen among children treated with deworming drugs, untreated children in intervention schools and children in nearby non-intervention schools. Combining these effects, the intervention was reported to increase school attendance by 7.5\% in treated children. Effects on other outcomes (worm infections, anaemia, nutritional status and examination performance) were also investigated. METHODS: In this pure replication, we used data provided by the original authors to re-analyse the study according to their methods. We compared these results against those presented in the original paper. RESULTS: Although most results were reproduced as originally reported, we identified discrepancies of several types between the original findings and re-analysis. For worm infections, re-analysis showed reductions similar to those originally reported. For anaemia prevalence, in contrast to the original findings, re-analysis found no evidence of benefit. For nutritional status, both original findings and re-analysis described modest evidence for a small improvement. For school attendance, re-analysis showed benefits similar to those originally found in intervention schools for both children who did and those who did not receive deworming drugs. However, after correction of coding errors, there was little evidence of an indirect effect on school attendance among children in schools close to intervention schools. Combining these effects gave a total increase in attendance of 3.9\% among treated children, which was no longer statistically significant. As in the original results, re-analysis found no effect of the intervention on examination performance. CONCLUSIONS: Re-applying analytical approaches originally used, but correcting various errors, we found little evidence for some previously-reported indirect effects of a deworming intervention. Effects on worm infections, nutritional status, examination performance and school attendance on children in intervention schools were largely unchanged.},
