I am a multidisciplinary data manager and analyst with over 15 years experience at seven Australian universities and the CSIRO, especially the ANU. I am currently a Data Scientist at the University of Canberra Health Research Institute. I am about to submit my PhD at the ANU.  Until 2013 I worked closely with Tony McMichael's Climate Change and Health programme at ANU. In 2014/15 I led the development of the data portal for the Long Term Ecological Research Network.  I work on data analysis that disentangles health effects of environmental changes from social factors. I give special attention to issues of data management, security, privacy and ethics, with my research into climate and mental health as a key motivating use-case.  

I have primarily worked in environmental epidemiology, building on the systems approach I gained from my undergraduate training in human ecology at ANU.  My PhD research focused on reproducible research pipelines, integration of heterogeneous datasets and statistical modelling of exposure-response associations in the context of complex multifactorial causality.  My studies include phenomena such as the effects of drought and extreme heat on mental health. The conceptual framework I used for integrating these data incorporates the idea of five interacting 'capitals' and I explored the areas of differential vulnerability across sub-populations, precision of spatio-temporal exposure estimates and general issues of geospatial data analysis methods.

I have been both lead author and contributing author on 22 peer-reviewed journal papers. I have contributed to 6 reports and 14 conference presentations. My Scopus h-index is 11. My contributions have spanned the range from designing study protocols, creating datasets, conducting analyses and communicating results. The integration of gridded, point-source and area-based administrative data has become a speciality. In particular I have experience in the integration of health, social and environmental data which involves reconciling health and socio-economic or population data based on incompatible spatial units.  I also am adept at the creation of linked environmental exposure maps and computer programming. Alongside my experience in analysis of empirical data I have experience in scenario-based forecasting in climate change risk assessments.

Reviewer #2
There are also no results of the validation of the Burns et al. (2014) analysis presented in the paper itself, so no way to evaluate the success or failure of this demonstration of the tool's capabilities. 
...
include more about the validation of the Burns et al. study, enough so that reviewers can evaluate the success of this demonstration,

The potential to map the adaptive capacity of Australian land managers for NRM policy using ABS data

Karen Cody, Peter R Brown, Phil Kokic, Rohan Nelson, Toni Darbas

    Report
    National Land and Water Resources Audit
    Product ID PN21327
    2007

Resilience, vulnerability and adaptive capacity are terms increasingly used in rural policy, but rarely defined or converted into practical measures that support policy design and implementation. Adaptive capacity measures based on rural livelihoods analysis have been developed and trialled using ABARE data for broadacre industries. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the potential to expand the application to all agricultural industries and to broaden the range of data used to inform the five capitals in the framework.

Rural livelihoods analysis can empower rural communities and policy advisers by identifying the attributes of adaptive capacity that can be enhanced through individual and collective action. It provides a pragmatic tool for policy agencies to prioritise capacity building towards the land managers in industries and regions most likely to benefit. An assessment of the model against existing national data sets suggests that ABS data could be used to create practical measures of adaptive capacity of Australian land managers.

There would be, however, a number of statistical issues associated with aggregating data from different sampling populations. A scoping project for a limited set of agricultural regions has been designed, to evaluate options to address these issues and to inform the usefulness of the adaptive capacity framework for development of policy advice.

***** DONE RWS rescaling theory
http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/99325/transforming-scores-between-different-rating-scales-importance-of-response-opt
 I'm using the following equation to transform scores between two different measures to put them on the same metric:

X2=((X1−min1)(max2−min2)
          /max1−min1     ) +min2

Where X2
= the score on the second measure; X1 = score on the first measure I want to transform; min1 and max1 = lowest and highest possible scores on measure 1; and min2 and max2 = lowest and highest possible scores on measure 2.

Three person bike, Kona brand cargo bike 
This Cargo bike (called a Ute, it is extra long) can carry two children and an adult more effectively than a tag-along trailer.
With attached handle-bars behind seat post and additional Xtra-cycle brand "PeaPod" child seat (imported from USA to specially fit the bigger bike).
Child seat takes smaller kids (up to about 3 or 4 years old), while the big kid can be as big as you like! 

This three person bike is great for the trip to childcare or the school.
Two large pannier bags provide ample space to carry the lunch-boxes, library books, a change of clothes for the office, etc etc (the kitchen sink).

This bike saved me from buying a second car for 5 years!

National Hospital Morbidity Database
The NHMD is a compilation of episode-level records from admitted patient morbidity data collection systems in Australian hospitals. It is a comprehensive data set that has records for all episodes of admitted patient care from essentially all public and private hospitals in Australia.

Lee-Koo, C., Henry, E., & Mathur, S. (2014). Cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease Australian Fact Prevalence and incidence. Australian Institue of Health and Welfare. http://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c4709
***** TODO imp-scale do separations clean and explore
Australian Institute Health and Welfare. (2013). Development of nationally consistent subacute and non-acute admitted patient care data definitions and guidelines. Canberra, Australia.

Each record in the NHMD is based on a single episode of care for an admitted patient. The overall nature of the clinical service provided during an episode of care is described by the data element Hospital service–care type, code N[N].N, also referred to as ‘care type’ in this appendix.
Separation is a term used to refer to the episode of admitted patient care, which can be a total hospital stay (from admission to discharge, transfer or death) or a portion of a hospital stay beginning or ending in a change of type of care (for example, from acute care to rehabilitation). Separation also means the process by which an admitted patient completes an episode of care by being discharged, dying, transferring to another hospital or changing type of care (AIHW 2012a).
Statistics on admitted patients are compiled when an admitted patient (a patient who undergoes a hospital’s formal admission process) completes an episode of admitted patient care and ‘separates’ from the hospital. This is because most of the data on the use of hospitals by admitted patients are based on information provided at the end of the patient’s episode of care, rather than at the beginning. The length of stay and the procedures carried out are then known and the diagnostic information is more accurate (AIHW 2012a).
It is not always the case that the length of a separation equates to the total length of time that a patient was hospitalised during a particular stay. When an admitted patient receives only one type of care during a hospital stay (such as only acute care or only palliative care), the length of stay for that separation is equal to the total length of time they spent in hospital during that stay. 

However, some patients receive two or more types of care during one hospital stay. For example, a patient may be admitted for active cancer treatment but later be reclassified as a palliative care patient. In such a case, the first episode of care would be completed by a statistical separation: type change, and a new episode of care would be started through a statistical admission: care type change. Thus, for such a patient, two episodes of care, or separations, would be recorded during the one hospital stay, with each separation having a different ‘care type’.

Box 1.1: Summary of terms and classifications relating to admitted patient care
An admitted patient is a patient who undergoes a hospital’s formal admission process. Statistics on admitted patients are compiled when an admitted patient completes an episode of admitted patient care and ‘separates’ from the hospital. This is because most of the data on the use of hospitals by admitted patients are based on information provided at the end of the patients’ episodes of care, rather than at the beginning. The length of stay and the procedures carried out are then known and the diagnostic information is more accurate.

Separation is the term used to refer to the episode of admitted patient care, which can be a total hospital stay (from admission to discharge, transfer or death) or a portion of a hospital stay beginning or ending in a change of type of care (for example, from acute care to rehabilitation). A separation may also be generated by a transfer between hospitals. ‘Separation’ also means the process by which an admitted patient completes an episode of care by being discharged, dying, transferring to another hospital or changing type of care.

Patient day (or day of patient care) means the occupancy of a hospital bed (or chair in the case of some same-day patients) by an admitted patient for all or part of a day. The length of stay (number of patient days) for an overnight patient is calculated by subtracting the date the patient is admitted from the date of separation and deducting days the patient was on leave (for example, went home for part of a day with the intention of return). A same-day patient is allocated a length of stay of 1 day.
A same-day separation occurs when a patient is admitted to and separated from the hospital on the same date.
An overnight separation occurs when a patient is admitted to and separated from the hospital on different dates.

The principal diagnosis is the diagnosis established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the patient’s episode of admitted patient care. An additional diagnosis is a condition or complaint that either coexists with the principal diagnosis or arises during the episode of care. An additional diagnosis is reported if the condition affects patient management. In 2014–15, diagnoses and external causes of injury were recorded using the 8th edition of the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, 10th revision, Australian modification (ICD-10-AM) (NCCC 2012a).

Draft Agenda:
- Permissions on folders:
  + X drive is not secure (and not recommended by IT - but they offered no alternative)
  + I went to eResearch committee with issues last November but this was not actioned prior to new team
  + New team arrival but M drive took too long to deploy, multiple IT
    errors, loss of faith, workarounds (storage on C drive)
  + folder permissions were randomly changed on a specif cay and we
    were all locked out, no explanation so far
  + issue resolved by us taking control? but still need to finalise our ability to create groups  
- Data access audits:
  + we have a bare bones data inventory
  + need to scale up to support security audits 
- Local processing with ArcGIS
  + required for adequate speed of disk I/O
  + requires security and syncing issues resolved
- Power settings and lockout
  + Issue has been mostly ignored by IT (too hard basket?)
  + multiple attempts have so far all failed
- Email spam rules
  + not enough information was provided to new staff about what rules are
  + we have noticed blocked NHMRC emails (this is business critical)
- Software installation
  + MLWin takes weeks and multiple reminders from users to service desk
    * too hard basket?
    * perception this is only a small number of users and little value?
  + ArcGIS pro: install is not working on all machines, service desk do not actively troubleshoot
  + SAS: installed without configeration to even perform ordinary regression models
- 2GB personal inadequate

Subject: RE: Permissions on folders
 
Hi Stef,
Toward a resolution of this issue I propose the following arrangement.
I have pasted below an excerpt from my position description with highlighted sections:
===========================================================================
 
Position Title:                          Research Fellow - Data Scientist
Business Unit:                         Centre for Research & Action in Public Health (CeRAPH), UC-Health
                                                Research Institute
Reporting to:                           Director - Health Research Institute
 
DUTIES:
[…snip…]
2.        Data management, including:
·         a. Manage large databases with spatial components to integrate health and social data on compatible spatial units and creation of linked environmental exposure maps.
·         b. Maintain a metadata inventory of data holdings, including functions for ensuring security, confidentiality, backups and licensing of the data and related software.
·         c. Identify demand for and designs options for a data extraction service to deliver linked datasets in a variety of formats as required by researchers’.
·         d. Adhere to data governance requirements and legislation.
[…snip…]
 
============================================================================
I propose that ITM make a document and put it on file that states something like the following:
 
Document Title: Research Data Folder Management Plan for UC Centre for Research & Action in Public Health (CeRAPH), Health Research Institute.
Authorised by: Director – UC ITM
 
1.        Research Data Folders at UC Centre for Research & Action in Public Health (the Centre) are stored on “\\ucstaff\dfs\Associated Organisations\Centre for Research and Action in Public Health”, known by Centre staff as the “M-drive”
2.        Permissions for folders on the M-drive are set by the Centre Data Scientist (or the nominated representative in the event they are not available).
3.        Folder access permissions will be set in accordance with conditions as per data release agreements.
4.        Furthermore, new users will have the DFS mapped to the M-drive by the Centre Data Scientist.
5.        In the event of an external audit of research data, the Centre Data Scientist will assume responsibility for providing evidence relating only to the security settings on the M-drive, to the exclusion of any responsibility implied for permissions set on any other networked computer drive related to the Centre.
6.        The role statement held on record by University Human Resources will specify that the Centre Data Scientist (and the nominated representative in the event they are not available) hold the following role:
Data management, including:
·         a. Manage databases of health and social data
·         b. Maintain a metadata inventory for ensuring security, confidentiality, backups and licensing of the data
·         c. Adhere to data governance requirements and legislation.
 
 
So then if ITM set up my profile to have permission to grant/deny access to all folders on the M-drive and we got audited then the above document and my/Neil’s duty statements would suffice to demonstrate a rigorous data security protocol.
 
To that end, if Neil could have this statement inserted as an addendum on his HR record then we would have an adequate system.
 
Cheers,
Dr Ivan Hanigan

Subject: RE: Draft paper: Bayesian blending for neighborhood air pollution exposures
Hi Ivan
Thanks for the opportunity to comment-apologies for the delay. I have added my comments to Jane's comments in the attached doc. 
1)Re your request on input to the discussion I have added a comment, but essentially I suggest it be presented as:
-Need to state what we found. Ie the BME resulted in a reduced RMSE error compared to CTM and SatLUR alone, and by how much.
-Then compare to other studies that have used these methods. Are there others apart from Akita? How much has this method be used for this type of analysis? (I didn't get the sense from the manuscript). I think not much, but you need to refer to previous papers in the Intro and then again in the Discussion.
-Can we provide any sort of estimate as to how much impact this reduction in RMSE is likely to have on the exposure-response function? This will indicate whether the effort is worth it.
-Strengths
Combining all data with different tempero and spatial attributes into one estimate. Making use of all available data with different characteristics.
-Weaknesses
Labour intensive; computationally intensive.
2) Also, I think I 
You said you would prefer to see the the 
- opening para in the Intro as one that is focussed on the crux of the
  paper, ie minimising exposure bias and misclassification, as a need
  for improving effect estimates.
- I think a para quickly indicating what exposure methods have been
  used to date; the issues associated with each (v briefly); would be
  more relevant.
- Then this can lead onto the issue of exp misclassification,
  etc. Issues with previous methods will relate to fixed site monitors
  providing great temporal resolution but not representing the range
  of expected pollutant conc; CTM being reliant on very good emissions
  inventories and is computationally challenging; LUR models providing
  good spatial resolution but needing to be adjusted temporally by use
  of monitored data, etc. 
- Could then mention that exposure misclassification has been
  identified as one issue leading to heterogeneity in effect estimates
  in epi studies.

 

3) I've also attached a recent paper which uses Bayesian modelling for exposure assessment (Giannini et al, 2017). 

 

4) Re the ref for the OEH monitoring you could refer to it's AQ monitoring plan, accessible here http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/air/nepm-air-monitoring-plan.pdf.http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/air/nepm-air-monitoring-plan.pdf. I think the relevant AS for NO2 determination is Australian Standard AS 3580.5.1.

Hi Ivan,

Here are some of my thoughts on the paper. I am not sure if this BME needs to be reported like a traditional Bayesian model, I am assuming that is not the case. I


Neighbourhood exposure paper

Comments

    My suggestion is that more of the BME method could go in the introduction then each of the data sources can be introduced as hard, soft or validation data in the methods.
    Not sure if it is possible for The CTM model to use a key or legend which matches the Satellite LUR and perhaps the IDW smoothed surface.
    It would be helpful to provide some information on the NO2 distribution of the fixed site monitor stations and passive samplers. I have noted that you have mentioned this in the results section as still to come.
    I think the covariance model and much of the BME specifics should go in the methods section.
    Just a thought, it looks like the BME is close to the LUR estimates perhaps you can discuss why that may be. Even though the passive samples hard data only comes from 14 data points it worth discussing, and what the impact would be if there was more hard data. Compare to the Akita situation. Also need to discuss how the CTM and LUR differ in magnitude and why that might be the case.
    Not sure if there needs to be something about the software used to estiamte the BME or if I have just missed it.

Thanks

Margaret

Subject: CAR information re exposure assessment workshop and emissions inventory collaboration

Dear presenter,
As you are aware the Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research (CAR) is working with the NSW OEH to facilitate a 3 day workshop on a national approach to air pollution emissions inventories - Tue 10- Thur 12 April 2018, and we are coordinating a half day session on "Air Pollution Exposure Assessment Approaches for Australia". The CAR workshop will be on the Thursday afternoon but it is hoped that CAR researchers will attend the other sessions too, to raise exposure assessment and health modeling ideas and issues, to highlight the issues of exposure assessment and health modelling, with the aim of better incorporating these issues into the development and implementation of a national emissions inventory.

The proposed presenters and titles are:

Exposure Modelling Approaches:

- Richard Broome NSW Health (in association with Martin Cope CSIRO) – Health gains from reductions in air pollution using scenario based CTM models
- Prof Fabio Ramos Uni Sydney School of Information Technologies and Centre for Translational data science – Informative sensing for improved air quality predictions
- Luke Knibbs UQ / Chris Cowie Uni Sydney – National and local Land Use Regression Models
- Ivan Hanigan Uni Sydney (in association with Martin Cope CSIRO) – blending data and models for improved population exposure assessment
- John Innis Tasmania EPA – Population exposure assessment in Tasmania
- Yvonne Scorgie NSW OEH – Population exposure assessment methods applied in NSW to support policy scenario analysis

You can amend your title if required.  

TIME ALLOTMENT:

Presenters will have 20min including questions - eg 15min presentation + 5 min questions, and there will be a discussion after the session.  A couple of presentation in the draft are by 2 people but we have nominated a "main" presenter.

For you information Mark Hibberd from the CSIRO who is a CAR affiliate and a strong advocate of a national approach to emissions inventories will facilitate the entire 3-day event.  Prof Guy Marks will facilitate the Thursday afternoon session, with input from Mark Hibberd to ensure continuity with the previous days discussions.  

VENUE:
Rydges Sydney Central
28 Albion Street
Surry Hills, NSW 2010


FUNDING:
Note that the OEH/EPAs will cover the venue costs and CAR will cover the costs associated with travel and accommodation (see next item) for CAR members and invitees who are attendees and presenters for the exposure assessment session.


ACCOMMODATION:
If you need to book accommodation there is a delegate rate (dependant on availability) of $229 per night, inclusive of buffet breakfast. You will just need to mention the block ID: 490756 when booking.

If there is any further information you need at this time just let me know.




****** remind cares etc to suggest
TO YVONNE
 let you know the CAR rep for the welcome and introduction, and the presenter for the CAR presentation on day one ASA.

Please let Ivan 

suggestion for a CAR person to do the followign for the Emissions Inventory workshop from 10-12april18 (program attached):

Name of CAR rep who can give a brief (2-5 min) talk during the short Welcome & Introduction session
I envisaged this will cover – intro to CAR and CARES, objectives of exposure assessment workshop to come, why EI is pivotal to exposure modelling & assessment and hence CARES members will be involved throughout EI workshop
 

Presenter name and title for the CAR presentation on Day 1 (morning) Information sharing session.
I understand that the focus of this talk will be on the role of EI for exposure modelling & health impact assessment. We have allocated 15min for all presentations in this section.  If some of the slots are not taken up we will extend presentations to 20min. Note that we have invited Martin and Beth Ebert separately to talk about EI & air quality forecasting.

****** budget
Re: Budget

I would estimate approx. $250/night for accommodation and $400 for interstate flights

***** DONE notes re cloudstor
I work for the University of Sydney and have a visiting fellow position at University of Canberra.
Under my Uni Sydney role I manage two cloudstor shared data collections:
1. p-usyd-CAR
2. p-usyd-CC_and_Health_Countdown

I use my Uni Canberra account to test that data sharing permissions are working as a test user.

Yesterday I noticed some unexpected behaviour under my Uni Sydnye account in which the contents of the 'Shared' folder was deleted and I did not remember doing this.  Below is the notes I took as I tried to figure out what has happened and how to restore the deleted data. 

- first I logged in to cloudstor website as ivan @ sydney and found Shared was empty
- activity log shows I deleted it on April 23rd Monday but I do not recall doing this (I was preparing for a flight to melbourne and spent very little time on the computer last monday). Anyway I did not mean to and want to restore it
- logged in to my remote desktop 'coesra', because owncloud was not running it was still full of data
  + took a backup to my home
- went to the cloudstor website as ivan @canberra and can still that environment general is still there (9 folders)
- went to cloudstor website as ivan @ sydney and went to deleted files and restored the Shared folder
- this  led to a new folder called 'Shared (restored)'
  + but notice that it doesn't have the Environment_General share, or the CC_and_Health_Countdown shared folders...
- went back to the cloudstor website as ivan @ canberra and confirmed that I can see these two big shared folders from that account
- stop investigating at this point as I think I need to ask the cloudstor support tomorrow (monday)

Hi Jane,

 

I am so sorry, I have just seen your email.

 

Definitions for Western Sydney vary. The most up to date is the one used by the Greater Sydney Commission (https://www.greater.sydney/district-plans)

 

We (OEH Climate and Atmospheric Science) have a slightly different definition (although we are likely to change this in the next few years) where we group our NW and SW together for Western Sydney  - http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/AQMS/aqi.htm

 

Once again, sorry about the tardy response!

Hi Geoff,

 

Regarding Figure 3.5.2, yes, please email us a version showing the CIs for these estimates of premature deaths.

 

Given you are revising this figure, could you please consider a few other minor tweaks at the same time:

 

·         The ordering of states/territories in the figure seems random, although the number of deaths generally decreases from top to bottom (the obvious exceptions being Adelaide/SA and Darwin/NT). Could you rearrange the order of states/territories so it goes from the largest number of deaths at the top to the smallest number at the bottom.

 

·         Can you make “Australian Capital Territory” at the bottom just “ACT” to be consistent with the other labels.

 

·         Should “Qld”  be “Qld.” to make it consistent with “Vic.” and “Tas.”?

 

Thanks.

 

Regards,

 

Paul.

Paul/ Ying

 

Thanks for pulling this huge amount of work together.  Sorry for my delayed response.   

 

Attached are my comments with input from Ivan, primarily on the air pollution and health sections.

 

Also, re:

Figure 3.5.2. Premature deaths from anthropogenic PM2.5 in urban and rural areas of Australian states and territories in 2015

It would be possible, perhaps preferable, to show the CI’s for these estimated of premature deaths.  These CI’s relate only to the Risk estimate applied to estimate the attributable cases, but give some indication of the uncertainty involved in these estimates.  Please let us know what you think.

 

Regards

Geoff

From last meeting the actions were:

1. Melanie Middleton to speak to whole CAR seminar.
TODO Ivan/Ana to invite MM to give a CAR webinar re Nat’l Clean Air Agreement (e.g. Aug/Sept?).

2.  nat’l emissions inventory WG one-pager and summary of meeting with NPI IWG (by Robin Smit) and presentation by M Middleton
TODO send to whole CAR.

3  presentations for health exposures session and put on CAR shared folder.
DONE

4. engage in stakeholder/community engagement stuff to help the EPAs/OEH/NPI IWG to ‘sell there message’ and gather support
TODO Perhaps a bit into the roadshows @ana (maybe one slide).

5. 1) comments on NPI discussion paper, 2) M Middleton will have a draft proposal under NCCA for agreement for comment (proposal for support for work toward a staged NAEI, support under the NCCA project delivery mechanism) >>> CAR can contribute to the business case.
TODO Ivan to add this to meeting 10 agenda. Ivan and Martin to coordinate with WG/email list.

6. 2.4 Data manager / curator / data auditor resourcing
TODO: specify role and amount for a SMALL data audit process ~10-15K? Luke commented that previous data worker (Cassandra) would be good.

7. Seed funding and etc etc. think about how we can actually provide more tangible assistance to grant applicants. Jane comments that it would be hoped that the seed grant applicant (with a CARES representative that gets involved – if a applicant has a heavy role for exposure assessment in their proposal).
TODO Ivan to do one pager. Send to CAR Exec

Hi Ivan and Margaret,

I have drafted up a structure for the 45 and up study protocol following our last meeting (see attached and Dropbox/SEEF_EHspatial/APTEMA/study protocol methods/APTEMA_Study_Protocol.docx).

Margaret, can you please complete the 4 sections under ‘Data sources’, I have included what I thought should be included in each section.
Can you also let me know when you can do this by?

Ivan, my understanding is that you have been working on data dictionary for the derived datasets. Can you provide some info in Data dictionary/Derived data?

Please edit directly in Dropbox with track changes on.
Add your suggestions/comments directly to the file in Dropbox as well.

Kind regards,

Subject: RE: mortality and air pollution paper

Hi Geoff and Margaret.

Luke and I have been working on a project with CAR seed fund (Geoff is a CI too)
called ExpoSim that utilises the synthetic census from the National
Centre For Social And Economic Modelling (NATSEM). That dataset only
includes age (in 5 year categories), sex, education and working status. The modelling with
45andUp also has numeric age and individual level risk factors (smoking, alcohol
drinks, BMI and marital status). My aim is to calculate parameters
from the 45andUp cohort to use when initialising the parameters for
the simulated cohort sampled from the synthetic census and exposure
surfaces. These parameters will be used in a inverse logistic function
to estimate each synthetic individual's probability of death based on
their attributes.

I will take the opportunity to also compare the results between logistic and
survival models in R, and also compare with those in SAS
(e.g. R defaults to Efron ties while SAS uses Breslow),
and there are a few other differences between my work
and Margaret's in terms of how the variables were constructed and the
resulting number of individuals in the 45andUp dataset with missing data.

I have only done NO2 for this experiment.

The following Summary is in dot points, and also see the attached figure:

- First comparison is after loading and formatting data I have 85,709 with NO2 data but Margaret had 77,226.
  + one explanation is that Margaret only kept individuals with complete data for model D
  + When I exclude those missing data for model D I still have 77,589
    (3484 events, 8257 dropped due to missing data)
- in Model A, we adjust with sex and numeric age (or age as time to event in surv)
  + we see no2 is large and significant
  + for the ExpoSim project we only have age categories (45-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74 and 75+)
  + the two logistic models are both slightly higher (first is with numeric age, second is with age groups)
- then Model B adds individual SES (e.g. education + working) and indiv risk factors RFs (smoking, alcohol and BMI - but not marital).
  + NB that the ExpoSim study does not have indiv RFs so this is just indiv SES.
  + no2 changes but still sign't in logistic, borderline in survival
  + both larger in logistic than they were in comparable model A versions, but each is about the same in survival models
- then Model C when we add marital status to the model that controlled for indiv SES and risk factors
  + no2 not significant
  + (NB this model not possible for ExpoSim)
- then Model D we add area-level SES to the model that controls for indiv SES AND risk factors AND marital status
  + no2 not significant
  + as an experiment we can fit a version of the ExpoSim model with area-level SES out of interest (but not marital status)
    * we see that it is large, significant, and similar to the result for the model with age and sex

So one way to interpret these results is that model B has adequate control for indiv SES and RFs, but then addition of variables with spatial pattern then takes over from air pollution.
This would be classic over-adjustment.

This is similar to the statement in Atkinson et al 2013 Epidemiology (Long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution and incidence of cardiovascular diseases):
"We think the adjustment [for area-level SES] is potentially important because it controls for many unmeasured confounders, such as diet and nutrition. However, because increasing deprivation was associated with higher levels of pollution (except ozone) in our study, there is a chance that this adjustment is removing effects of air pollution. The finer spatial resolution of the Index of Multiple Deprivation variable in some urban areas may represent fine-scale variability in the pollution levels not captured in the 1 × 1 km resolution of the pollutant estimates"

So part of the argument against putting too much emphasis on the marital status and area-level SES models might be that A) if you control for indiv SES and risk factors then B) the signal that is left in the residuals has a spatial pattern that can either be explained by C) marital status (because single people are more likely to live in central suburbs, which are polluted - TODO is this true?), or D) area-level SES which are also more likely to be in polluted regions (again, TODO, is this true)... or then it could be E) - both. So those two variables can therefore explain the variation instead of the air pollution variable.

I think we should also consider the definition of confounding and intermediates when talking about this.
Importantly a confounder cannot be on the same causal pathway as the exposure, but they just co-vary with either the exposure or response.

I think an argument can be made that both marital status and area-level SES could be on the same pathway.

For example:

Increasing odds of not being married --> increases odds of living in central suburbs (lack of kids, happy with smaller houses etc) --> increases odds of living in polluted area --> increases odds of exposure and hence disease

and

1) Increasing levels of disadvantage --> increases odds of living in low SES area  --> -->
2) Increasing levels of air pollution --> increases undesirable real-estate (lo cost) --> -->
\\
  (3)--> --> increased odds of exposure and hence disease

So in this way these variables might be part of the causal pathway and therefore multivariable regression cannot easily disentangle the relationships.

Great thanks Geoff,
I recommend we change the name to "all cause mortality aptema 20180510.docx".
I am working in the SURE APTEMA workspace for another hour or so to complete my logistic models.
Then I will not be in there for a fair while (several days).

Kind regards,

Ivan

Subject: mortality and air pollution paper
Margaret/ Ivan

I have completed an initial pass through the Mortality paper and made substantial changes.  See:
C:\Users\51006480\Dropbox (Sydney Uni)\SEEF_EHspatial\APTEMA\Mortality_MargaretR\paper\current\ all cause mortality aptema 20171215v2_IH edited MR 20171218 - gm180104.docx

I ran out of steam at the end of the discussion section.  I think this section still needs more work, primarily lining in the relevant literature.  I have yet to review the recent Pinalt paper (attached) that Luke mentioned at the APTEMA meeting today.

Could you both have a look at the paper.  I have included several specific questions around methods and results for Margaret.   I propose that Margaret address these questions specifically and also review my changes.  I propose that Ivan take responsibility for revising the current version (including my proposed changes and Margaret’s responses/ comments).   Once this is done I will then meet with you both by phone to discuss.

In the meantime I will keep working on the discussion in between times when you are both working on the manuscript.

Ideally this would be ready to circulate to co-authors by the end of this month

Coarse particles (PM 10 ): Levels are highly variable probably depending on dustiness or frequency of
bush fires. The peak (99%ile) in 2006 was 85 g/m 3 due to alpine fire events. The peak (99%ile) in
2015 was down to 40 g/m 3 . However averages remain similar at 18 g/m 3 .

Fine particles (PM 2.5 ): Levels are again highly variable and strongly influenced by bush fires. The peak
(99%ile) in 2006 was 37 g/m 3 due alpine fires in December and the peak in 2014 of 29 g/m 3 was
due to the east Gippsland fires in February that produced a significant impact over all Melbourne.
The average in 2015 at 7.6. g/m 3 is slightly higher than 2006 at 7.5 g/m 3 but overall shows only a
very modest downward trend 3 .

put on agenda of cares/ caret.  We should make these surfaces available, or at least look make the link available and provide a summary of the strengths and weaknesses f using these data

I was talking to Mike Brauer last week and he mentioned the web sites below – which I wasn’t aware of.

 

It looks like these data would be useful for a range of our projects

The Koplitz paper used Geos-Chem model.
Thanks Geoff. I’m already liaising with Randall Martin and Aaron von Donkelaar at Dalhousie Uni re: PM25 for Australia. They have a great group there and are responsive.
