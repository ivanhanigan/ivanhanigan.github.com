 either as re-run suidrt Rnw, or if not 'climate' enough do the hutchinson drought vs nswdpi paper?


Dear D,
I am interested in your invitation to volunteer https://drclimate.wordpress.com/2015/11/05/a-call-for-reproducible-research-volunteers/

I have almost finished the PhD I have been doing part-time since 2009,
on the human health effects of climatic exposures
(droughts and suicide, bushfire smoke and respiratory disease,
heatwaves and heart disease, etc).  I found during the course of the
projects that constructing datasets of all the climatic
and social factors, and then adequately controlling for confounding in
statistical models to be very difficult. Furthermore I realised that
many of my results were sensitive to choice of analysis procedure, or
otherwise error-prone due to the many steps.  Such difficulties have
led me to frame my thesis in terms of using data analysis pipelines to
address the reproducibility crisis.

If you think it is worthwhile from your perspective I would be happy
to contribute to your project as I think it will give me some more
traction on this problem in my next papers.  I like your proposed approach. 

I have two options that you might consider. 

First I went to great lengths to publish a reproducible research
report along with my paper on drought:

Hanigan, I.C., Butler, C.D., Kokic, P.N. and Hutchinson, M.F. (2012).
Suicide and drought in New South Wales, Australia,
1970-2007. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the
United States of America, 109, 139505.  doi:10.1073/pnas.1112965109

I created the reproducible research report using the literate
programming language Sweave, and submitted this executable file for
review along with the paper. The code is hosted on Github:
https://github.com/ivanhanigan/SuicideAndDroughtInNSW/blob/master/SuiDrtNSW_SupportingInfo.Rnw

I could offer my opinion about the strengths and weaknesses of this process if this suits you?

Second, potentially the above project is not purely climate science
enough for your purpose, so I could also offer this other related line
of inquiry.  From the drought project I also produced the Hutchinson
Drought Index R package
https://github.com/ivanhanigan/HutchinsonDroughtIndex and the
associated gridded dataset 1890-2008. The Australian National University Australian Data
Archive. doi:10.4225/13/50BBFD7E6727A.

I have acquired the NSW Department of Primary Industries drought declarations for Pasture Protection Districts from 1986 to 2012.  The paper I intend to write will assess how well the Hutchinson Drought Index correlates with the declared agricultural droughts.

Let me know if you are keen for this contribution and if so what I
need to do to help you in your endeavour.

    Thanks Damien,
    I'm pleased to join you on this.
    I've downloaded your log files http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1385387 and started looking.

    Quick response to your queries (I'm meant to be doing edits on the thesis and writing my conclusion!):
    Speaking for myself, and I think this applies to a lot of general R users, we either never learned the 'convention over configuration' lesson, or don't put it into practice very much. 
    The only thing that is pretty standard is to write down all the methods steps in a script or a set of scripts.  It is recommended by some to take a modular approach and write a script for data cleaning, another for exploratory data analysis, then another for model selection.  then a main script is recommended to splice together the final run like this:

    #### main.R ####
    source("clean.R")
    source("eda.R")
    source("modelling.R")

    This kind of got formally defined with Josh Reich's LCFD framework originally introduced in his answer on stack overflow here http://stackoverflow.com/a/1434424, and encoded into the makeProject R package http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/makeProject.  Lots of R users picked up on this approach.

    The Sweave approach goes one step further than simple scripts, as it integrates with LaTeX to compile the document (a Compendium as per Gentleman & Temple Lang doi:10.1198/106186007X178663).
    You are correct that this is unwieldy for intensive or protracted computations.
    I am aware that one can tell the Sweave engine to cache computations and only execute chunks of code that have changed since last run, but I usually just run a chunk once, designed to create a data file or graphical output and then set the 'eval' flag to FALSE so that when I compile the document it is really just sending the reporting parts through LaTeX and just assumes all the computations have completed successfully. In this way I build up the document piece by piece as the steps get done. Unfortunately this does lead to a disconnection between the compute and reporting that has landed me in sticky situations more than once!  I usually set aside time to run the entire analysis at the final stages, by doing a find and replace to set all the eval=FALSE to eval=TRUE, and run in a fresh workspace.
    I also keep a worklog of all the steps in a simple table with 3 or 4 columns labelled: 'step', 'inputs', 'outputs', 'description'.  This is pretty good actually to keep track of the many things going on throughout the analysis project.

    But I also note that the Drought and Suicide paper relied on a lot of pre-processing to have been done prior to that workflow being able to run (e.g. I combined rainfall grids, calculate drought time series, average over regions, interpolate census populations, clean mortality data, link things, test things etc). That took months.

    For this and other reasons I don't think Sweave scales all that well. For an approach that scales up you might like to look at http://projecttemplate.net/ but it has a lot of 'software engineering' jargon that does not appeal to me directly (lib/ profiling/ tests/?) as my training is geography and ecology, not computer programming.

    An interesting reflection on the PNAS publication is that they could not actually review the Sweave file (the website did not take the .Rnw file as a valid upload), so in the end I just sent them the compiled PDF output and a link to the Github version.  I am not sure anybody actually looked at the R code, but I am claiming that this was 'peer-reviewed' along with the manuscript and SI document.

    I'm keen to get your guidance on how to incorporate software carpentry in my work.
    Let me know what you envision next steps for your reproducibility experiment.

    Cheers, Ivan.

        Hi Ivan,

        Thanks for your offer to volunteer - it would be great if you'd have a go at adhering to my proposed communication standard for your next paper! Any feedback on the experience would be very much appreciated.

        Thanks also for the information on your PNAS paper. I'm especially interested in your use of Sweave, which essentially replaces the log files (of command line entries) that I provided with my Journal of Climate paper:
        http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0287.1

        As a Python user I'm not 100% familiar with the typical workflow of R users, but I get the sense that writing command line programs (that are then stitched together into a workflow using a shell script or a build manager like Make) isn't something that is typically done? I'm assuming R scripts can be called from within Sweave, so perhaps Sweave is a more natural workflow management tool for R users? If this is true, I'm wondering how it would scale for larger data analysis project? For instance, do you have to execute the entire paper at once, or can you just update individual sections (e.g. you might not want to re-run a very time consuming analysis every time you want to simply update the text in the paper)? I'd be interested to hear any thoughts you have on the scalability of Sweave and whether a command line approach would actually work for R users.


        Regards,
        Damien


        PS. Apologies for not citing your PNAS paper in my list of example reproducible studies in the introduction of my BAMS essay. I'll certainly cite it in my PhD thesis (which has a chapter devoted to the reproducibility stuff contained in that essay) and when I get the page proofs back from BAMS I might try and sneak in a citation to your paper.

From: rsph.all-bounces@mailman.anu.edu.au <rsph.all-bounces@mailman.anu.edu.au> on behalf of rsph.all@mailman.anu.edu.au <rsph.all@mailman.anu.edu.au>

Subject: [Rsph.all] Review of Mental Health Research and Teaching at RSPH: call for submissions
 

Dear Colleagues,

 

We have decided to undertake a review of mental health research and teaching within the school. The terms of reference (TOR) for the review are in the attached document. This will be an internal CMBE review with targeted invitations for external submissions. All RSPH staff are invited to provide written submissions. We will be holding a meeting of the review panel on December 21st, and individuals or groups can arrange to meet with the review panel on that date.

 

Please send your submissions, or your interest in attending the meeting of the review panel, to Laura at rsph.executive.support@anu.edu.au by the date indicated in the TOR. If you wish for your submission to remain confidential, please indicate that in the email to Laura – such requests will be honoured and confidential submissions will only be seen by the review panel.

 

Given the potential impact of the review recommendations to the school, I have decided to delay release of the RSPH strategic plan until the new year, after the review panel has met.

 

Best wishes,

 

Archie

***** TODO ucrh 0601 UCRH Files files planning deploy to SURE workspace, test on Rstudio server (swish? or NCEPH?)
As part of this write some simple doco like a DMP but focus on pipeline workflow
Use examples of Neuro
- neighbourhood

- seef analysis plan 
- sabrina work
- noise
- DMP, datainv, workplans, worklogs, workflows, distribution, group/individual

** UCRH Noise
*** Noise prelim
**** data
***** TODO ucrh 0603 UCRH Noise Get support from stakeholder groups 
***** TODO ucrh 0603 UCRH Noise Test exposure estimation process
- is there questions about the best way to attach the exposure to a participant 
- would you attach the mean, min and max of the building?
***** TODO ucrh 0603 UCRH Noise List limitations of the preliminary model.
- After prelim modelling we decided the results are good to go into a more refined doco
- the discussion turns to limitations about 
a) source (roads, rail etc), need for QC/validation
b) target (buildings, shape, height)
c) barriers (the RMS or property developer built walls)

***** TODO ucrh 0603 UCRH Noise Reporting
Ivan, Ben and Geoff (all welcome)
Oct
TODO writing up our findings so far. 
possible the document could be "Data Requirements for a Noise Model; A Case Study of Sydney NSW"  and so a brief lit review on the noise model followed by a data inventory and the case study is about the attempts at data acquisition (and I assume discussion of the lack of available data or limitations and blah blah)

***** TODO ucrh 0603 UCRH Noise Hunting data
- Look around in data.gov, NSW ‘SIX’ eXchange site, AURIN
- TODO focus on buildings/ traffic counts.
- TODO LATER
***** TODO ucrh 0603 UCRH Noise Literature collection
All
Ongoing
TODO example Jal sent a few papers on noise esp aircraft noise
This is low priority, see 3. Reporting task above.
Geoff noted he has students who are doing a lit review on indirect effects of noise on health.  Ben has stuff.

***** TODO ucrh 0603 UCRH Noise Traffic Counts
URGENT TODO Christine still to supply Zenith.
DONE most of the traffic files that Christine had are shared with Ivan now. RMS traffic XLS, RMS Roadside Device, RMS Permanent Active Counters, Bankstown (Jal likes this one close to bankstown airport – only a secondary airport, Fairfield don’t want new airport, Liverpool do). traffic counts XLS, Hawkesbury Traf counts XLS, Randwick Bondi Junction Traf count estimates, Willoughby Traf counts XLS, Zenith (estimates) . (councils only count for high-ish load roads – not complete + camden).  Also Geoscience Aus Elevation files.
Confirmed that haven't looked at building attributes other than differentiating between high density and low density residential land use

***** TODO ucrh 0603 UCRH Noise Review data ‘shopping-list’
All

DONE See items below.  Note that we group datasets into clusters.  Also note that Christine mentioned airplanes which we hadn’t noted before. (Ivan has now added to list)
Agreement to Focus on building first and traffic counts second. 
Geoff mentioned LiDAR.  Not added to list yet.  This would be added to the building polygon dataset.  See notes for 2. Buildings
